The Attio reduplication, especially common in Homer,
consists in taking the initial vowel of the root with the
following consonant as a syllable of reduplication, e. g.
ὅδ-ωδα.

This reduplication is regular where the vowel of the root
is short, e. g. ἀρ-λρ-υῐα, ἀκ-ᾰχ-μένοα In Attic we have ἀκ-ἡκαα,
ἐδ-ἡδακα, ε’λ-ἡλυθα, ὄλ-αλα, and others. This mode of redu-
plication was originally confined to a few forms, then extended
by analogy. Thus from sscd we have in Homer ἐλαδώς, but
the sk. perfect is dda, Lat. idi.

ln οἶδα (εξαιδα), Sk. vida, there is no sign of reduplication.
Perfect forms without reduplication are also found in the
Homerlc δέχαται, ἔρχαται.

Originally the stem of the perfect varied between a fullvariation
form in the singular active and areduced form elsewhere. οἱ ”²³¹⁴
Thus we find in Homer-

Sing. Plur.
old-a, Sk. vid-a ἴδμεν, sk. vall-md.
ἕ-οικ-(ι dlx-mv.
’γέ-γυναι ‘phys-per (εγε-γρ-μεν).
pal-pom pt-pa-rov (= pepp-ror).
rufus laborve-afrum)-

This variation of the stem was originally accompanied by
a shifting of the accent (p. 77), but this shifting was not
maintained in Greek. The stem was for the most part made
uniform throughout in Attio. Thus in ἔοικα the original
*ε’-ικ-μέν was replaced by dola-aper, poet. ἔοιγμεν, whlle
instead of α’λή-λαυθ-α, pl. *ἁλία-λαλῶμεν, we have in Attio the
weak stem in ἐλήλυθα, ἐληλύθαμεν.

The proper vowel of the root iu the perfect was α,
as in λε’-λογχ-α, θέ-δορκ-α, δι-ἔ-φθορ-α, but this has osten
been replaced by ε, as ln πέ-φευγ-α, admeto-rot, λε’·λειπ-ται,
etc.

Iu the participle active we find a variation of the stem
between the masculine and the feminine, which-is due to the
