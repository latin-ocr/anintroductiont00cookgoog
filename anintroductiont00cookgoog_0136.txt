Third

124 Person Endings.

Third Person Plural.

(r) Primary endings:

(a) -νη, I.-E. ·nli, e. g. Doric φέρο-ντι, Att. Φέρουσα, Sk.
blatra-nti. In Homer we have τιθεῖσι (rade-m), διδοῦσι
(dido-vra).

(b) -αντι, -ᾶσι, 1.-Ε. -ζιίί accented, eg. Epic ἔ-ᾶσι, Att. ἲ-ἃσι,

Sk. s-dntz} y-dntz, ἆγνΰ-ῖισι, μεμά-ᾶσι. As hiatus was not ad· ’

missible in the original language, the hiatus of the Greek forms
seems to point to -σασι as the original ending, as in ἴσασι for
ἰδ-σᾱσι, and εἴξασι sor cix-nour. Sanskrit has vidus, as against
Gk. fat-unm. It may therefore be thatin the perfect -σᾶσι
has replaced a shorter ending -σι, e. g. ibon If so the longer
ending is due to the analogy of ἔ-ασι, loca, which have also
provided the type for Att. redi-fior, διδό-ᾶσι.

(c) -δτι, -ἅσι, 1.-Ε. -gtlt' unaccented. Homer has λελόγχ-ὅσι,
πεφύκασι, and there is a Doric form ἐθώκ-ἅτι. But this is an
unusual ending for the perfect, and is formed probably on the
analogy of -αται of the middle, e. g. τετεύχαται. See p. 126.
If -σι were the original ending in the perfect, nepos-ue· could
stand for πεφυξι with a of the perfect intruded. Cf. p. 138.

(α) Secondary endings:

(a) -ν(τ), Ῑ.-Ε. ·nl, ἕφερο-ν, Lat. era-nl.

(b) ·ov(r), Ῑ.·Ε. -g'tl, ἔλυσ-αν.

From N on-thematic verbs we have the Homeric ἔσταν, ἔβαν,
ἔφαν, etc.

The optative ending is -εν, eg. εἶ-εν, but an earlier -uvis
justified by the Elean ἀποτίνοι-αν, avve-av, and the so-called
Aeolic aorist optative, e. g. τίσειαν. The ending -εν may have
been assimilated to the quality of the vowel in εἴ-ην, εἴ-ης, or
followed the analogy of the aor. ἐφάν-ην, &priv-ys, ρ1.ἔφααεν.

The ending -σαν appears in the strong aor. ἔβη-σαν (ἔβην),
ἴθι-σαν, ἔγνω-σαν, in the optat„ as in Epic σταίησαν and ein-vav,
and in late forms like ἐλάβωαν, and is probably due to the
analogy of the sigmatic aorist‚ e. g. flue-av. lt also appears

,in the plupf, e. g. Epic τέθνασαν, and in the aor. pass.
