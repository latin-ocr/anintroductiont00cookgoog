116 Numerals.

ho in hic (tei-ce), hade, hoc, hue, etc.

ol· in ol-lus (ille is later and on the model of ipsc), nal-tm, oI-r'as.

al-, alio· in tal-ter, alio-s.

qui·, Gk. τι· in qui-s, qui-d, qui-a, puk Gk. ao- in qui (quoi), etc.

qut, Gk. τε· apparently in cottrilie. cuius for mundis, quius.

The relation of uter, aba} etc. to the Gk. stem πο- in κόπρος
is very obscure, for while the meaning and formation are in
many cases identical, there is no trace of an initial guttura!
in Latin. In nec-ubi, etc. the c probably belongs to the
negative, and it is not found at all in neuter.

The characteristic points of the inflexion of prononns as
distinguished from that of substantives are as follows :-

Nom. Sing. masc. and fem. in -ἱ, quo-i (qut), qua-i (quae), ete.

Nom. Sing. neut. in -d, quo-d, qui-d, istud, τί-(δ), τά( ).

Gen. Sing. in dus (only in Latin, unless we sce it in the Greek
ipe-gos, ineis-but it is not found with the personal prononns in latin).

Nom. Plnr. masc. and fem in -ί, Ιιο-ι’ (ha), Ira-i (has), ol, αἱ, etc

Gen. Plur. in ·som with a preceding long vowel, originating apparently
in the feminine, istorum, istd-mm, arf-om (τῶν), etc.

The forms sor the nom. and gen. plural have, as already
explained, been extended to the corresponding cases of the

A· and O-declension of substantives.

Tun Nuunnens.

The One. (1) Stemsom-,sem-‚spz·,sm·. Greek όμός, ὅμοιος, ὁμοῦ,
Numerals. εἷς (σεμς), ἕν (σιμ), μία (σμ-ἰα), μῶνυξ (σμ-ωνυξ), ἅμα (spemn, an
instrumental), ἁ-πλοῦς (ηιμ), ἅ-λοχος (spu). Latin stin-plac,
nir-guli, stin-ilis. Sz'nzul is probably related to Gk. ἄμυδις,
as alticd to ἄλλυδις. Semel is better divided semel, where
the termination is the same as in Germ. ezir-mal, the original
meaning being ‘a time by itself.’
(2) Stem orbe. Greek οἵνη. Latin ethonomus, unus, cf.
noenum = rte-o num
The Homeric la, ῖῷ are obscure. Perendie cannot be
connected with unus, but more probably contains a similar
form to Gk. παρά (perp).
