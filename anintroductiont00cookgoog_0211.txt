x.] T he Indicative. 199

εἰ ἔστι, siest, etc. These are the most general uses ol the
mood. But as language developes, its functione seem to be
emended. This can be illustrated by a comparison ol
Homeric and Attic syntax, when we find that in Attio the
uses of the subjunctive and optative have become limited,
while that of the indicative has been extended. For instance,
in Homer, the optative with ἄν can¹ be used of a past condition,
e.g. καί vti trev ἕνθ’ ἀπόλοιτο ἅναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγαμέμνων, would have
penthad· in Attic only the imperf. or aor. indic. could be so
used. We find the use of the indicative extended so as not
only to denote facts, but also to imply the non-fulfilment ol
a condition, e. g. καλῶς dv εἶχεν, it would have been well.

In sentences expressive of wish the use ol the indicative
implies that the wish was unfulhlled in the past, eg. εἶθ’
ἐγένετο, would it had happened. Properly perhaps the optative
was the mood of unlulfilled condition, but the mood which
possessed the augment and could denote the past was
employed to shew that the imaginary event was referred to
the past. This is borne out by the fact already noticed that
the optative could be used in this sense, and that Latin uses
the historic tenses of the subjunctive.

Of the future indicative we have already spoken. It stands
apart srom the rest of the mood, for in meaning it goes
closely with some os the uses of the subjunctive. ln Homer
we have the future used with κε’ν, e. g. ὁ δέ κεν κεχολώσεται, be
wz'll be angry, and olten it is hard to say whether a form is
aorist subj. or fut. indic. The future is also used in final
clauses like the subjunctive. In Latin the similarity and
indeed partial identity of form between the pres subj. and
fut. indic, and perf. subj. and fut. perf. has been already
noticed (p. 157). Latin, however, does not go so iar as
Greek and substitute the lut. indic. for the subj. in final
clauses. The two moods on the contrary, though formally
much more akin than the corresponding forms ol Greek, are
syntactically kept distinct.
