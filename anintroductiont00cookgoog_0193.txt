rr] The Ablatr've. 181

usage, e. g. perenni fronde coronam, points to an ablatival
origin.

Ablatival is the use ol the genitive with comparatives and
superlatives, where the case expresses the starting-point ol
comparison. Of a like nature are the genitives which are
constructed with verbs expressing excellence, wanting, etc,
e. g. λείπομαι, δέομαι. To the same class belongs the genitive
ol price, the meaning ol which is ablatival, e. g. ἔλυσεν
ἀποίνων, released in return for. This genitive might however
go as the true genitive with a noun, e. g. τεύχεα εἰειιτὸν βοῶν,
arms eff or worth one hundred oxen, and similarly in Latin
magni, tanti, ᾳιιανιίί, etc.

The Ablative survives as a distinct case in Sanskrit and Ablative.
Latin, and roughly speaking corresponds to the uses ol the
ablatival genitive in Greek, that is to say it is the case ol
separation and origin.

The other usages of the Latin ablative are due to its
absorption of the instrumental and in part of the locative
cases. The instrumental had two meaningS, corresponding
to the two uses of the English welle. It denoted either the
means or the accompaniment ol the action, whether persons
or circumstances. The latter meaning is usually made clear
by a preposition, but survives in Latin in isolated expres·
sions mostly belonging to military language, e. g. omnebus
copzi's proficiscitur. The ablative of the read by whtilr ie, to
judge from Sanskrit, instrumental, and therefore jugis venire
must be separated from πεδίοιο θέειν.

The transference lrom the instrumenta] ol accorponrinerrtrnstm.

to that ol means arises from instances in which the accom· mental.
paniment is also the means, e. g. νηυσὶν ὀχεῖσθαι, curru vehi.
Here besides the ordinary Latin ablatives of cause and restru-
ment are to be placed the ablatives ol price, like the Greek
dative in πρίατο κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖσιν (Hom), and offullness, like
lhe Greek Ἕλλησι πλήρεις πόλεις (Eun).
