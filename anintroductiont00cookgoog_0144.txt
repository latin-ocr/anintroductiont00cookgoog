to a passive meaning, and from the active to the passive voice. The
passive aorists ὲφάν-ην and ὶκόπ-ην are similar in form to the active
ἔστη-ν, and it was upon the model of such aorists as ἔστην that the
passive aorists were formed. Of similar formation, though with a vowel
of different quality, arethe aorists ὲβὶων, ἑάλων, ἐγήρᾶν, ἔδρᾱν.

The aorists in -θην are different. Tbese forms are not modelled ou
the active but are closely related to the middle voice. Thus side by side,
and with the same meaning, we find in Homer δυνάσθη, δυνήσατο-
ὲμνήσθην, ἔμνησάμην-ὡρμήθην, ὡρμήσατο-ννὴῦε in Attic ἐβουλήθην,
ἐδεήθην, ἐπορεύθην have the use and meaning of the middle. Moreover
the second singular ending -θης answers to second singular -tluis of the
aorist middle iu Sanskrit. From this ending -θης the θ was extended by
analogy to other persons. Thus we may assume a middle aorist in
Greek iii-nna ἔδό-θης (sk. ddi-rias), ἔδοτο (Sir. Adi-ta) from which
were formed two tenses, the middle aorist (ἀπ)-εδό-μην, -έδρν, -έδοηο
etc, and the passive ὲδό-θην, -θης, θη, etc. The aorist in -θην was as-
similated to the aorist in -ην both in form and meaning. The ending
-σ-θην properly belongs only to stems ending in σ ora dental.

'thematic In Sanskrit the thematic vowel is a; in Greek it is ο
before nasals, elsewhere ε, a variation which must be rc-
garded as original. In Sanskrit the person-endings are

Present·
sterns.

the same in thematic as in non-thematic verbs; in Greek
thematic have primary ending -ω, -εις, -ει, non-thematic -μι
-σι, -τι,

111 Greek we sometimes have the thematic ε even before a nasal in the

infinitive forms, such as ἀρχέ-μενοι, φορ-έ-μεν, any-epona, and in
participial forms such as βέλ-ε-μνον, ripe-avos.
