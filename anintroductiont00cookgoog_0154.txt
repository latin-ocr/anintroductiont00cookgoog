The Conjimctive.

Ind. ἃλ-το ιΕοιῄ. dit-oroi.
,‚ iptio-cujacii „ epta-mo.
,‚ ὲπέπιθ-μεν ,, veroid-oper.

So in Sanslrrit-
Ind. lain-ti Conj. hdie-avi.

Where the stem ended in a vowel contractiori ensued.
' In the Homeric θῆ-ο-μεν, maj-opo there is no connection,

but we cannot look on these as original* because such hiatus

was inadmissible in the original language, as in Sanslcrit

(a) The conjunctive of tenses which in the indicative have
a thematic vowel, e. g. presente lilce φέρ-ψμεν, was marked by
lengthening the suffixes ο and ε, e. g. φέρ-ω-μεν, diffinire.

The Latin serci- os the conjunctive points to an original
I.-E. stem bhero- sor this mood. lf so, φερᾱμεν, pepon have
passed to φέρωμεν, φέρητε on the analogy os the quality of the
vowel of the indicative φέρ-ο-μεν, φέρ-ε-τε.

The long vowel has become in Attic Greek the charac-
teristic of the conjunctive alike in thematic and non-thematic
tenses. Traces oi the old conjunctive with a short vowel
remain in the so-called futures ἓδ-ο-μω, πί-ο-μαι, which are
really conjunctives Even in Homer some non-thematic
tenses have a long vowel in the conjunctive, e. g. ἅλ-η-ται
(indic. lli-ro) and πέμψ·ω-μεν (indic. ε’-πέμψα-μεν).

Α full degree of the root seems to have been proper to the
conjunctive, e. g. from iser we have ἔω, Att. d, Sk. osci-m}
Lat. ero. The Homeric conj. εἵδ-ο-μεν, beside the indic. οἶδ-α,
seems to point to the middle degree with ε as the proper
degree of root for the conjunctive.

Optatzive.

Optative (ι) Where the tense is non-thematic in the indicative, the
Mood. optative suffix is -ιη- in the sing. ol the active, and -ῖ- in the
dual and plural active and all numbers of the middle.
