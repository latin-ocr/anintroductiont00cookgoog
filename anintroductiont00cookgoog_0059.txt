lv.] Nasal Sonants. 47 ’

In Greek verb-forms we sometimes find a nasal sonant.
Thus in πένθ-ος we have a full es πενθ, but in ἔοπαθ-ον a
reduced §suffe in χείσομαι for χενδ-σομαι a full dxcvi, but in

ἕ-χαδ-ον a reduced esxgm: in >ti-how: a full es λογχ, but in
ἕ-λαχ-ονα reduced es hpx.
Other instances are

τέ-τον-α, vespm, τέ-τα-ται-«Ικτεν, imp-per, emm-poros,
neppam, πέψω-ται.

II. The nasal sonant sometimes appears before ξ, when Before „t
epenthesis ensues and m is changed into n as in
1AE gip-1¹0 βαίνω (aph) ven-io.
Instanees in Greelr with original gt are
τεκταίνω, σπερμαίνω.

ΠΙ. Like l and r, so too m and n sometimes appear before Before
a vowel as prm, pn, Gk. αμ, αν, Lat. em, m, vowels

I.-E. ἐμώ, rand-phemone, ten-uis
Other instances are

hrrgrmov, &remor-xpm, xapa-i—hrrtrpnw, *turbati-⁶1¹⁴
(agam).
