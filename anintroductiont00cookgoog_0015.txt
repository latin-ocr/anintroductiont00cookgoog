made up. The Sanskrit grammarians analysed words into

separate syllables, and noted the influence which neighbou'ring

sounds had upon one another. The discovery therefore ol

the Sanskrit system of grammar gave great impetus to our

science, since lor the purpose of the comparative study oi

languages we must know with accuracy the sounds ol each

language and have therefore to break up words into their

component parts.
Our object is to compare the sounds and ‘words of the Changes ot

Greek= and Latin languages as to their form, and to shew Sound.
how they have descended from a common origin. ln this
¹descent they have passed through a perpetual series ol
changes; for language even at the present time is alteriug
slowly but surely from generation to generatim, and the
alterations must have been lar more numerous and far more
rapid in ages which possessed no literature and no printing
press to check the tendency to change and keep it within
bounds. The parent language from which they, in common
with other kindred languageS, are derived, split up into
dialects and these dialects eventually developed into so many
distinct languages, differiug from one another in countless par-
ticulars‚ which changed, and in the case of those still spoken
continue now to change imperceptibly. If all these changes
had to belearnt separately no benefit could be derived from
learning them. But they admit of being grouped together
under general statementS, which are called Laws. For in—

instance we can group them under the general law that the
Greekxsound is represented by the sound ol English h. Such
laws are called Phonetie Laws, and may apply either to a
single language or groups of languages, or to the whole
body ol language, according as they are special or general. .

Phonetie laws are based upon the fact that when change Phonetie
