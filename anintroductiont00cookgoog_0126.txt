114 Pronouns marking gender. [ch.

Possessive pronouns are forms from the stems of the
personal pronouns used adjectivally and declined as O-stems,
e. g. ἐμά-ς, σός for eft-r, dr sl. wan For the plural in Attic we
find ἡμὲ-τερο-ς, ὑμέ-τερο-ς, cf. Lat. riosler, vester with compara-
tive terminations, but in Aeolic ἅμμος, oppos, Dor. ἇμός, ripis.

Σφός and σφέτερος have been formed on the analagy of ὅς
and ἡμέτερος.

Prononns The article ὁ, ἡ, τό was, like all definite articles, demonstra-

{ffligg 0ftive in its origin, as we see from its Homeric uses. ὁ, ἡ, τό

gender. answer to Sanslrrit sd, sci, lod. The final consonant of the
neuter os this type is to be seen in Lat. id, quod, as wellas
in Sk. ta‘d, and in Greek ποδ-απός, etc. The declension os
ὁ, ἡ, τό and the nominal O-declension have been assimilated
to one another.

The noma plural ot, at, for original τ-οί, τ-αί as in Doric‚
Sk. tl, have become the model for the nom. pl. of A· and 0·
nominal declensions The lem. gen. pl. τάων corresponds to
Sanskrit nisam, and became the model ior the gen. pl. of the
A-declension, eg. θεάων, θεῶν. With addition os suffix -de to
the stem of the article pronoun we have ὅ-δε, ἥ-δε, τό-δι, and
from the same stem the adverbs ὧδε and ὣς( ).

The origin oi οὗτος can perhaps be seen in τοῦτο for τό.
ῦ-τό, which comes from a doubling of the demonstrative con-
nected by ὐ, the reduced form of αὖ, answering to the enclitic
Sanslrrit particle u, which means ‘further'

ἐκεῖνος. In Attic ἐκεῖνος, poetic κεῖνος, the diphthong -ει- is not
original, and before the archonship of Eucleides was repre·
sented on Attic inscriptions by ·ε-. Lesbian κῆνος, Doric
κῆνος, τῆνος.

The origin oi the oxytone αὐτός is unknown ; its deciension
resembles that of ὁ, ἡ, τό. ’

The stem os the relative ὅ-ς, ἢ, ὅ answers to Sk. yet-r, I.-E.

gos. To this stem we may refer the relative adverb ὡς.
