Indo-European ἕ = Greek ε, Latin ἔ.

ἔστι, est; γένυς, gainem τέ. qu& γένε(σ)ος, gabin φέρω, fl‘m δέκα,
dicem ἕδ-ρα, sella (for sid-lah ἀ-στέρα, stella (for stlr(u)la); ἑπτά,
septem ; ἕξ, sex.

ἔ remains unchanged in Latin before r, at the end of a
word, and before double consonante. But in an originally
unaccented syllable before 3 single consonant it passes to ἴ
(collzgo-lego, dgz'ntt'ntssdydpevor), and also before gir· and
before nasals followed by gutturals.

The sound of the Secondary ει, which arose from con-
traction of εε 3ηά other causes was originally a different
sound, viz. 3 long close e', less open than η (p. 66).

The Latin diphthong ei seems to have been pronounced
with a sound midway between ἱ andi, and with one or other
of these sounds it early became identified. Only in the
earliest inscriptions is it to be taken as 3 true diphthong;
elsewhere it is merely a graphio representation of ε· or i.
Praetically even in the very earliest inscriptions we findi
and ei side by side. So great is the confusion between the
three sounds ei, r', ἱ, or rather so near did they approach one
another in pronunciation, that we find ei used to represent ῐ, ἱ,
even in cases where thereis no trace of an original diphthong
