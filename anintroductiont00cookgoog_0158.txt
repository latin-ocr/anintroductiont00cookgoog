case as the verb, and in them is to be found the origin ol
the infinitive.
In Sanskrit these case-forms expressed purpose and con·

sequence. In Latin this use of the dative case was
common. In Greek the dative was not so employed. Con· ἵ
versely while in Greek we have the infinitive continually used

to express purpose and consequence, in Latin this use of the
infinitive is almost confined to poetry.

The nominal origin os the forms ol the Infinitive was
sorgotten and they were no longer regarded as case forms.
For instance, as the ending -αι was not preserved for the l
dative ol nouus, the origin os δόμεν-αι was lost sight of, and
it was brought into close connexion with the different stems
ol the verb. As beside ἔδοσαν there stood δώσουσι, so beside κ
δόμεναι rose δωσέμεναι, and other infinitives for the different
tenses, with constructions similar to those ol the Finite
Verb.

Termina- The ending -θαι appears in ἦσ-θαι, πεφάνθαι, iarah-dar,
ἶὲἶῖἓεξὲῂθτσύχ-θαι of the perfect. With this ending we can compare
Sanskrit -dhydzi

The ending -σθαι stands related to -θαι as -σθε to -θε in
the second person plural indicative (p. 126). This ending
appears in different tenses, viz. τίθε-σθαι, ἰδέ-σθαι, heli-odai,
tica-odat, tior-odat, and has become the common Greek lonn
sor the middle.

The suffix -μενω, Sk. ·mdne, which is Epic and Lesbian,
appears in fid-trevae, (ii-perot, γνώ-μεναι, papir-perat of non-
thematic tense-stems; in εῖπ-έ-μεναι, etc. oi thematic.

The suffix -μεν, which may be locative, appears in ἰ’-μεν,
brt-po, τεθνά-μεν after a short vowel; and in the thematic
εἶπ-ἱ-μεν.

The suffix -εναι (= -fevar, Sk. -udnel appears in the Cyprian
defruor, Sk. dri-va‘ne, and in i-s'vuu δεδι-έναι, εἶδ-ἔναι, and many
instances where a long vowel points to the absorption os ε,
as in δοῦναι, θεῖναι, στῆναι, βῆναι, ἁλῶναι, ἀῆναι, ete. Later, -ναι
