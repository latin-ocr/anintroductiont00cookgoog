168 Tae Noun. [cn

ἀντωνυμία (pronomina), μετοχαῖ (paranate), ἐπιρρήματα (ad-
verbia), and προθέσεις (praepositiones). The ἐπίθετον (arisa-
tivum) was a division os the ὄνομα. As in the Latin language
there was no article, the Romans kept eight parts of speech

tives; in κοκά, eatis, we have an adjective acting as a
substantive.

In the inflexion of Nouns we have to consider Genea,
Namber, and Care.
