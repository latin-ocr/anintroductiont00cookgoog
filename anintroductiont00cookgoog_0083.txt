Original Greek -τι changes into -σι in dido-rr, λέγον-σι, Semi-
πλαῦ-σιος, hri-ors, except after σ as in ἕσ-τι, σία-τω, mio-rer. mels·

κζ, yy', ry' pass to σσ, Anic π.

ny in ἥσσων = vlle-ywv, cf. ἤκωστα.
λαύσ-σω = heve-yon cf. heve-ds.
χμ in γλῶσσα = thx-yn, ef. *rhox-fs.

μέλισσα - prbr-yn, cf. adher-os.
0! in κορύσσω = reopvdyor, cf xlm-o.

The Attic ττ seems to be of subsequent origin to σσ, for
in some cases, e. g. λύσσα (ιααάαεεα), the σσ carr be proved
from Sanslrrit to come from the original language. The
sound of rr was probably spirant in its nature, as we may
see from ’Ardr'r beside ’λπικὴ.

dy· and γέ pass to ζ, as in

Ζεύς = Agens, Sanslrrit dydds, Lat. diss.

Before p, as, for instance, in ὲ-ρυθμός, Lab ruber.

Before λ in ἀ-λείφω, beside hir-a andin ἔ-λαχύς, Lat. Ievis.

Epantlzesz's occurs where the semivowel g* influences aEpenthesis.
preceding syllable ending in ν, μ, ρ, σ or f. The semi.
vowel μ’ disappears‚ and an ι is developed in the preceding

syllable, which is thus made more palata] in sound.
