22 Semcwoweis and Glt'des. [ch.

The Vor'celers or Hard' consonants are the Tenues p, t, k, q,
the Asparated Tenues kl, tl, ph, and the sz'rants eſs

There are some sounds which can play the part of either
consonante or vowels. Such are the semivowels i and u,
which as vowels are written i and u, as consonants ῥυ) and p
(w). In the same way m, n, r,lcanbeusedasvowels, when we
shall write them gn, g, 0r, g. Whether they are used as vowels
or consonants depends upon their position. Between vowels
they are purely consonanter, but before or after consonants
they can be vocalised or made sonant. In such aword as
saddle the l sound is vocalised or sonant, while in captarit the
n-sound is sonant in the same way. .We might write them
saddg and captp.

Besides the different sounds which we have classified, we
have the introductory glides represented by the smooth and
rough breathings. In singing a good singer begins from
the outset with the voice, and allows no breathed introduc-
tion; in speaking there is an introductorybreath before vowel
sounds Is stress is laid upon this initial glide, there ensues
the rough breathing ·}r, in which the organs oi the mouth are
kept apart as sor a vowel sound‚ but the vocal chords do
not vibrate. The rough breathing may be regarded as an
emphasised initia] glide which varies in character according

to thc following vowel sound. It can also come at the end
of a word.
