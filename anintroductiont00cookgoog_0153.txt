etc, is due to the analogy of stems ending in σ or a dental,
e.g.' ζέσὲσαι, eckeo-not, ἱρέα-σαι (epte), xciv-caro (gad), where Ι
double σ is regular. In Attic the σ is not doubled‚ e. g. καλέ-

σαι, triti-ont.

T lte Futura.

The Future is formed in three ways 2-(1) by adding theTneFuture.
suffixes -σο, -σε to the verb stem, as in the active στῆ-σω,
dri-oo, Sk. dd·syd·mt'‚ in the middle abedoc-pat, dri-tropat,
The suffixes are added to aorist stems in the passive μιγή-
σομιιι, davi-copae, and to perfect stems in the active τεθνήξω,
ἑστήξω, and passive γεγράψεται, εἶρὴ-σε-ται,
(a) An indeterminate vowel which appears in Greek as a,
e, 01· ο, precedes the suffixes‚ e.g. rev-vi=rev-e·o=rev-r·oo,
sk. tanavd-mi. This vowel belongs to the root of the verb
in ὄλ-ὣεόλε-ωεόλε-σω, κρεμ-ὣεκριμ·αωεκρεμ-α-σω, ὀμοῦ-

μαι = dpo-o-pm = ὀμο-σο-μαι.
(3) A third form of the future springs from a ‘contamina-
tion’ of the future in -σω and the future in -εω (wo). This

we have in the so-called Doric futures φευξοῦμαι (prorumpat),
πλευσοῦμαι (alewino-pot), os Which the correct Attic forms are
φεύξομαι and πλεύσομαι. In Homer we have ἐσ-σεῖ-τω and
πε-σέο-νται. In Doric before ο and ω we have -σι sor -σε,
e. g. in πραξίομες (way-oaorem), just as θεός is Doric for deris.

In the above classes it will be seen that σ is sometimes
kept between two voweh‚ e. g. στῆ-σω, τιμή-σω, as in the sig-
matie aorists, while in other futures, eg. καλῶ (calcea), βιβῶ
(β ooo), βαδιεῖ (dodran) the σ disappears‚ though in the
corresponding aorista e. g. ἐκάλεσα, it remains constant.
Without contractiori σ is dropped in ‘’pi-o (ἐρυ-σω), dvi-a
(ἀνυ-σω) and in the Homeric τελέ-ω, κρεμά·ω, etc.

Conjunctzive Mood.

(ι) In Homer where the indicative tense is without aThecon·

thematic vowel, then the conjunctive mood is marked byjunctive

the thematic o, r, eg.-
