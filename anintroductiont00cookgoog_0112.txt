as compared with absens, in flexuntes, and perhaps in the
forms of the gerundive in -undus (ferandus torserunt-nos).

Stems ending in s shew iew traces of stem variation.

1. Stems in -ος, -ec shew a variation of ο to ε in

γέν-ος, ymo-os (γένους).
gen-us. gen-eras.

The stem of αἰδώς is atton, but -εσ- survives in αἰδεσθῆναι.
The acc. αἰῶ is for alf-omn, beside which we have αἰεί, ἀεί,
for the loe. alf-wa. The long vowel of this stem comes in
Ὶε’π-ηε-τιινός. 1

Nouns with these sterns are mainly neuter, and mostly
have ε as the vowel of the root, with some exceptions‚ such
as βάρ-ος, and post-homerio πάθ-ος, fido-oe, etc.

’ ln Latin the normal type shews avowel variation, as in
genus, gener2i3 but not unfrequently uniformity os the vowel
is introduced, as in tempus, temporat, though the e sometimes
survives in cognate forms eg. tempestas. The formation of
new masculines and feminines in -ον, -ora has been spoken
of above. The feminines in -e's like sedes seem to be in the
same way new forms as compared with the Greek ἕδος, though
they find their parallel in the Greek adjectives εὐγενής. In
declension they are assimilated to I·stems (sedzlum, sedibus).

2. Stems in -ασ- occur in γῆρ-ας, xpi-as, where a answers
to a sk. -i- as in kran-is, shewing that the vowel is inde-
terminate.

ln Latin these stems correspond apparently to forms of
the type czizr's, ceneris (ef. serenus sor seres-nus, Gk. σέλας),
though if this is s0, the change os gender is to be noticed.
