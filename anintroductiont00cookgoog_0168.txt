(cf. σπένδω), to which mordeo, spondeo are related as φορέω
to φέρω.

There are some traces of the reduced root appearing
in the Latin perfect It has however in every case been ex-
tended throughout the tense, and is no longer confined to the
plural—stet-r' (for ste-sta), sata· (formast-1), de-d-r'.

In other cases the shortening of the root vowel seems due
merely to the fact thatin the rst and 3rd sing, and indeed
originally in all persons, the accent fell upon the reduplica-

tion. (pl-ptg-t' dpag- in pac-tus).

In perfects of another type we find the characteristic to be

v w ³ an unreduplicated stem with a long c'corresponding to a

present stem with a short vowel (J‘ict'² je'ci, se'di, etc). Of
this form various explanations have been given. lt may
perhaps be possible that se‘di is for se-sd-i, and is therefore
really reduplicated‚ but to explain fici as standing for fasc-i
seems phonetically impossible.

It is therefore better to suppose that we have here a totally
different method of forming the perfect. οἶδα, sk. olda, Lat.
miliare universally regarded as primitive formS, and no one
would explain them as containing a reduplication. The
same may be said of jecz'if it corresponds to the Greek ἧκα,
which though an aorist in meaning is obviouslya perfect in
form. ἧκα will then stand for gysa, and must be separated from

ῗημι, if we put'this form with Lat. sero for siro (σι-ση-μι). In j
these two cases we have instances of a primitive perfect with 1

a long vowel standing by the side of a present with a short

vowel ; and this is the type that, though rare in other lan· Ὗ

guages, appears commonly in Latin: cf. scribo scribi, fddio
fodi, vinti) vini, rideo se'dz} oziaco vict} sdgr'o frigi, frango
frigi, etc. “

ln the case of four verbs with stems beginning witha
vowel we have relics of the augment substituted as in Greek
for the reduplication, igi, c'dr', emt} -c'pi (in co-ipr't Lucr. 4. 619)
