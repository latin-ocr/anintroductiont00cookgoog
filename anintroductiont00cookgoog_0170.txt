r 58 Perfect in -Vr

fel&(o)lyv, and ought to keep a long ῖ throughout, but asa
matter of fact confusion with the future perfect is very
common.

Beyond this it is not for the present safe to go. None
of the current theories as to the relation between the two
systems of inflexion, and as to the origin of the perfect ter-
minations in Latin are satisfactory, and it is probably better
at present to confess our ignorance than to catalogue a
series of makeshift explanations.

vldz'sat. viderim similarly corresponds to the Greek optative

2. The Perfect in -viis peculiar to Latin, and possiblya
new formation after the confusion of perfect and aorist forms
and meanings in the type ir1 -sz' had made apure perfect form
desirable. ln Sanskrit‚ roots ending in -ᾱ (1.-.E ᾶ, ἱ, ὁ) form
the 1st and 3rd sing. of the perfect in -ou (esda perf. dadau).
To this Latin has added the -i which, whatever its origin,
is the appropriate ending of the rst sing. of the perfect, and
we getpa-o12no-v13le-vi, se-vr] etc. ln the case of roots
ending in -ί (eg. iz) even in classical times the form without
the u is more correct. On the other hand sunit is older l
than ficit. In a certain number of words the v is radical
(sou-i, mov-i, lau-i, cau-i, juv-i), and these would have helped
the extension of the type by analogy.

The perfect in -m' is plainly inseparable frorp that in -zu',
but is not yet fully explained. lf, however, -vi came to be
taken as a perfect ending, then a stem gene· as seen in
yevsorv'y, gene-trix, genitus, might form a perfect gem-vi which
would become genoui and genui (cf. denovo=denuo, Gk. affor).
From a few verbs of this type the ending -m’ might be
extended to such cases as monui, serui, aperui, praecinui, etc.;
and the extension would be helped hythe analogy of those
perfects where-the u was radical (ruz, pluit, nuel), those verbs
formed with the suffix -au (ster-nne) and the denominatives
of the type metu-i.
