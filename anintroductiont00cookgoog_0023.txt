romanie (in the Tyrol, Engadine, de), and Ronmanian or
Wallachian.
The Umbro-Oscan group consisted of the Umbrian, spoken Umbro-

in the east or north midlands of Italy, and the Oscan, spoken ΟΜ·
in the south midlands. Into the details of these languages it

is not necessary to go here. One or two points of interest
in their bearing on Latin may be noticed3 (r) the use in
Umbrian of a modified D at the end of words and between

Α vowels‚ which in the Roman form oi the Umbrian alphabet
is written R or RS, and explains the Latin forms ar-bz'tcr,
‹rr-cesso, orsuerunt, which seem as far as the prefix is con·
cerned to be horrowed3 (2) the preservation of sigmatie
futures (Umbrian benicet: venr'et, Ossan dadestzdabr't, cf. Latin
saxo, jusso), and the preservation of s as the termination
of the gen. sing. and nom. plur. of the A·declension (Umbr.
tutos or totar=urbes, urbas, cf. Lat paterfamilzos).

6. The Celtic family comprises a northern group, con· Celtic.
sisting of Irish, Gaeiic, and Manu, and a southern group,
composed of Cymrie, Cornish, and Armorican.

7. The Teutonic family is divided into (r) the Eastern, com· Teutonic„
prising ancient Gothic, and Scandinavian with its subdivisions 3
and (a) the western, consisting of English, Frisian‚ and the
Low and High German languages. Our knowledge of
Gothic is confined to the fragments of the Gothic trans·

1 lation of the Bible made by the Arian bishop Ulfilas in the

fourth century. The Scandinavian group, which goes most
closely with the Gothic, comprises Icelandic, Norwegian,
Danish, and Swedish. Of the western group, English, Frisian,
and Saron go together3 from Saxon sprang the later Low
German dialects. High German is distinguished from the
other Teutonic dialects by a different treatment of the mutes

(p. 83). From High German and its dialects sprang the
speech of the greater part of modern Germany.

8. Of the Baltic and Slavonic family Baltic contains the Balncand
three divisions of Old Prussian, Lithuanian, and Lettish. Slavonic.
