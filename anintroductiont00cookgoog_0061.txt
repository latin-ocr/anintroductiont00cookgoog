nature of the following sound.

In Sanskrit before a proper, u, diphthongs and liquids‚ the
Velars are represented by k, g, gh, but before i or before an a
which answers to an European e, there is a change of k, g, gh
into the palatal sounds clEngl. ch), j, h (for jh), correspond-

but as part of the sound of the Velar guttural itself. It is less
perceptible than the full sound of the spirant p. Wherever
this labial sound is to be sound in the Velars, we find them
assuming different forms according to the nature of the
following sound. The labial sound does not appear in
Sanslrrit Velars.

labials π, β, φ.

In Latin without labialisation the velars become c, g, gh
(which is generally represented by g or h); with labialisa-
tion kf becomes qu or c; gt becomes gu,g or v; gh
becomes f, b, gu or v.
