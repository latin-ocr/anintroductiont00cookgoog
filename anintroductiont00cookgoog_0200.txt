that deponents have present and future participles of an
active formation must be due to the existence of an earlier
active form. We see then that in the Latin deponents the
passive and the middle have been combined while the corres-
ponding active voice has gone.

As the Infinitive was in its origin an oblique case ofa
noun (p. 146), it does not properly admit of distinctions of
voice. In Sanskrit it has no such distinctions, while in
Latin there isa special form in the passive only for the
present stem. In Greek fresh infinitives have been formed
from the different tense-stema in both active and middle, and
so instead of a single infinitive form, eg. δοῦναι, far gairz'ng, we
have δώσειν, δίδοσθαι, δεδόσθαι, δοθῆναι, etc. Still, ln such an
instance as θεμιστόκλῆς ἄξιαι· ἦν θαυμάσαι (Thilo), was worthy
for admirang, the infinitivo has its original abstract nominal
force.

The different tense-stems denote the time of an action.
In some sentences the time is absolute and has no reference to
any definite point of time, as in such an instance as A centaur
is α ficlzim of lhe paels, which applies to past, present, and
future alike. Further, an event may be present, past or future
with reference to the time of speaking, viz. is happening, has
happened, aaz'll hoppen. Again an event may be present, past
or future with reference to some point in the past, viz. war
happene'ng, had happened, zoas to happen, or to some point in
the future, viz. well he happem'ng, will have happened, well be
going lo happen. Where the time denoted by the verb is not
relative to the time of speaking, it is relative to the time of
some other verb in the sentence. For instance in θεμιστοκλῆε
ἥκει the time of ἧκα is relative to the moment of speaking, but
in ἔλεγεν ὅτι θεμιστοκλῆι ἥκει it is relative to the time of ἔλεγεν,
an event in the past. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin we have

. different tenses to express present, past and future in re-
