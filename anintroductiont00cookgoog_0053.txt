Ill Semi-Votvels. 41

equus, Sk. aqvas is unexplained. Before vowels ε pasees into
ι in some of the non-lonic dialecto, as in Boeotian θιόι,
Laconian σιόι, ansvering to Attic θεόι, and in Boeotian λἰι
beside Attic ἐγὼ.

The grammarians regarded a change to υ as especially a Aeolio¹ υ.
mark of the Aeolic dialect. Thus Epic ἄμυδις (cf. ἄρα),
ιῖλλυδις (ἄλλω), &nacolii-spot, rrtiyraros, ιιῖσυμνήτης (alna) were
accounted as Aeolisms

Other instances of the appearance of υ in close connexion
witha liquid are διαπρύσιοι, πρύτανις, πρῦρνιι, πρυλέες (πρό),
ὑπόβρυχα (flevit-l·

The semivowels of the Indo-European alphabet are ρ’, p, r, The Semi-
I' m, n· vowels.

The characteristic ofa semivowel is that under certain cir-
cumstances it plays the part of a vowel, i. e. it is capable of
forming a syllable by itself either with or without accom-
panying consonants, while in other cases it is a consonant,
that is, it possesses no proper sound of its own but combines
with a vowel proper to form a syllable.

For instance in ἔπιθον the ι is an independent syllable-
lorming sound, but in ἔπειθον it is a dependent sound
ancillary to the proper vowel of the syllable, namely ι. As
it is with ι in the stems πιιθ-, πιθ-, so it is· with v in the stems
φενῪἾ φυΫ·

When these semivowels corne between two consonants
they are independent vowel sounds: when they follow imme·
diately on a vowel they become merged with that vowel into
adiphthong: when they come between a consonant and a
vowel they are fully consonantal, and are then written
by us ρ’, ry.

The Indo-European consonantal y, ansvering in sound to Indo-

English y, and also called from the Hebrew name the yod· Europeany.
sound, appears at the beginning of a word, in Greelt as <the
rough breathing, in Latin as j, and in Sansltrit as y.
