98 Nasal Stems. [cs.

We cannot overlook the fact, oi which however no

explanation has yet been offered, that words with the suffix 3
-τωρ have the strong root but a paroxytone accent, while ¹

those in ·τηρ have the weak root and an oxytone accent.

Nasal Stems with ‘strong inflexion’ have four possible
degrees oi the suffix.
-on ‚m -u ,ἓ

σῶ-φρον ppei-ds κυ-ν-ός πρό-φρασσα
(= mamm)-

No stem shews all these degrees. For instance we do not
find

acc. ποι·μον-α, loen aroc-pom, gen. aot-uror, dat. pl. ποι-μα-σι (e ποι-
pap-oe).

One or other os the degrees is used throughout, eg.
-μεν- in ποι-μὴν, ποι-μέν-ος, and -μν- in the derivative aroc-prior,
but -ον in τέκτ-ων, τέκτ-ον-ος, so that the distinction os strong
and weak cases has been lost.

A wealr stem appears in κυ-ν- oi κυ-ν-ός as compared
with κυ-ον- of κυ-ὡν, and in ἀρν-ός (εἶν-ος) as compared with
πολύ-ρρην, which points to a declension, Nom. ῥην, Acc. pqr-a,
Gen. o'p-wis.

Most osten the weak stem is found only in derivativas,
eg. ποι-μν-ἰον, ‘year-vio, etc.

Various other suffixos are added on to nasal stems‚ eg.
·to- in cogno-mendum. In Greek this suffixis added in
ὀνό-μα-τα, but not in ὄνο-μα, Lat. no-men. The same suffix -to
appears in ἤπα-τος (the stem of which is proved nasal by the
Lat. ᾖεῖη-τέ) and in eido-ros, πείρα-τος, noea-ros. The nomina-
tive oi these words ends in -ρ, e. g. lurp, εἶδαρ, οὖθαρ, where ρ
may be the remnant oi an adjectiva] suffix -νο (ci. ὕδωρ
beside ὑδαρός).

In Latin occasional instances of vowel variation in in·
flexion are found, eg. carnin) carmi, bernoin) homz'rn's (oi
which the older type was hemo, minzi), andavery remarkable
