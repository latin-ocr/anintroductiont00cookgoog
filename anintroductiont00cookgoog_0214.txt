202 Concord. [ct. ’

Greek a singular verb is used with a neuter plural subject
and this in anic Greek is the rule. In Homer, however, we
lind that it the plural mn be regarded as a whole or unity‚ it
is generally constructed with the singular, whereas il its
separation into parts is emphasised‚ it is constructed with the
plural. Thus of the timbers ofa ship as a whole we have
δοῦρα σέσηπε, but of a number of separate spears δοῦρω μακρὰ
ἤϊξαν. This represents probably the idiom ol the original
language. As to the dual we may remark that as it fell
into disuse the rules of strict concord were neglected.

The grammars will give instances ol other types where,
e. g. the subject being in the singular and the predicate in the
plural, the verb agrees sometimes with the first, sometimes
with the second, a good deal depending on its proximity to
one or the other; or where the verb agrees not with the
subject but with something in apposition to it or to which
the subject is compared (ὅσοι ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς ἐπιβουλευόμεθα). In
every case the principle is the same; the verb originally

agreed with the subject, but concordance hasbeen extendedin ¹

there is no absolute necessity for using the case sign twice. 3
In such an expression as ‘Lord Bacon's works' we are con· l
tent to use it only once. The fact is thatin ‘LordBacon’ ἶ
the two words were originally in apposition and, both per· ;

forming the same function in the sentence, would naturally
both be in the same case. But in modern English the con-
nexion between the two words has come by usage to be very
close. stan earlier stage of the language we should havea
form corresponding to the German des Herrn Carlyles‚ which
was still in use at a recent date, though even in German
we should now say des Herrn Carlyle.
