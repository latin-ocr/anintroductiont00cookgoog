The name Augment is a translation ol αὔξησις, and is hugment.
applied to the sign of past time in the Historicol tenses of
the Indicative. The Augment is either (ι) &llario appearing
as ε prefixed in verbs which begin with a consonant3 or
(a) lemporol, where the initial vowel of a verb is lengthened.

It appears in Sanskrit as well as in Greek. lt is to be
regarded as originally a separate prepositional word ex-
pressing priority, which in course os time was combined
with the verb into a single word, e. g. I.·E. lley'qom, is in
Greek ἔλειπον. Even in Greek there are signs that the aug-
ment could be detached from the verb. In Homer the syllabic

Ι augment is often omitted, eg. βῆ sor ἔβηε in Herodotus the
temporal augment, eg. ἔρξαν lor εἶρξαν.

The Augment was also originally accented, signs of which
are that all augrnented forms are barytone and the rule of
Greek compounds by which the accent does not pass back
beyond the augment, e.g. παρ-ἔσχον.

Where the stem of the Verb begins with a vowel we have Temporal
the Temporol Augmenl, e. g. ἦγον. We need not suppose that augment.
the contractiori os e with the vowel of the verb-stem took
place within the limits os Greek. The Attic ἦν (erat), Dor.
ἧς, Old Sanskrit cis, come from an original I.·E. lest, and, as
εε contracts in Greek into ει, the contractiori into η must be
regarded as prehistoric. Upon the analogy of ἦν, etc.,a
lengthening of the quantity of the initial vowel carne to stand
lor the Temporal Augment, eg. from ὅρνυμι we have ὦρτο,
whereas ἐ-ορτο would contract in Greek into οὐρτο, and from
ἷκετεῦω we have ῗκέτενον, noi εἷκετευον. Where ε remalns
