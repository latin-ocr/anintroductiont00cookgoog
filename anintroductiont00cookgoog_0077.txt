Conarwarrorvs ou Sousus.

Now that we have dealt with the different simple sounds
in Greek and Latin it remaius to consider the combinations
ol those sounds in words. This has been partly touched
upon in speaking os the diphthongs, which are composed os
sounds originally distinct but have come to be uttered in a
single emission ol the breath.

Iu the original Indo-European language Htirtur', that is the Hiatus.
contact ol two neighbouring vowels without connection, was
inadmissible. For example, from Sanskrit we are able to see
that where suffixes beginning with a vowel were added on to
stems ending in a vowel, contractiori took place, or is the
vowel were ior u, an intervening semivowel was developed.
Thus Lat. patr-ius, Gk. πάτρ-ι-ος allow of hiatus between iand

u, and r and ο, whereas in Sanskrit we find prb-lyae where
a y has been developed between i and a. Like Sanskrit the
original language did not admit ol hiatus and, wherever we
find it in Greek and Latin, these languages have deviated
srom the parent speech.
