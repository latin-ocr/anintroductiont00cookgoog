rra] Ionian Alphabet. 25

was invented or borrowed elsewhere for i ψιλόν. The
Phoenician Van was retained in Greek as the digamma, f,
which is still extant in inscriptions and the sound ol which
is required by the metre in the Homeric poems, though it
is not there represented bya special sign. These letters,
along witha and the consonante u, r, Δ, rr,n,u,w,11, r, r,
which were borrowed with little change ofsorm, are the letters
which, according to tradition, were brought from Phoenicia
by Cadmus. Oi the other letters the symbol H was used
ln some Greek dialects, asin Italy, for the sign of the
roughbreathing. In the ionic alphabet, as adoptedin Attica,
the rough breathing had no sign, but Η was employed as
the sign ofa vowel.

The Phoenician Q, Koppa‚ iell into disuse; it survived
longest in the alphabet of Chalcis, whence it passed into the
Roman alphabet as Q. In classical Greek the sound of φ
was not distinguished from the sound ol K, but Q survives in
old inscriptions. In Ar. Nub. a 3 we have κοππατίας used of a
horse branded with this letter, just as the old σάν or com-
pound ααμαῐ (Hdt. 1. 139) is preserved in the word σαμφόρας
(Ar. Eq. 603 3 Nur. 122, 1298).

The Ionian alphabet came into general use throughout Ionian
Greek-speaking tribes in the fifth century. A special feature alphabet.
oi this alphabet is the use oi the symbol H to represent, not
the Spiritus Asper, but the long open vowel α’. The same
alphabet also distinguished between 0 and Ω. 1f H and
o were simply long varieties of Ε, 0, it is odd that the
Greeks should not have distinguished between long and
short in the case oi other vowels. Before the adoption of
the lonian alphabet in Attica in the archonship os Euclides
403 nc, E did duty for Ε and El, wherever El did not
represent an original diphthong. Apparently then the symbol
Η was adopted to represent the same sound as the open ἱ os
Italian, and in the same wayo represented not simply long ο
but a more open sound. > ,
