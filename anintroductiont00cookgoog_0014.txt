guages of the nations he conquered with the speech of his
fellow-countrymen. As long as Greek and Latin remained
the only ancient languages known, the study of languages
made but little progress. There was not sufficient ground

the study of words was confined to more or less successful
hunting after etymologies

Greek, Upon the discovery of Sanskrit it became clear that

{ffisffid Sanskrit, Greek and Latin were all closely related to one
another. The words for father and mother and other words
of relationship, the names of parts of the body and of animals
as well as the numerals in all three languages resembled one

corresponding forms of Latin and Greek, yet many of the
peculiarities of Greek and Latin are not derived from
Sanskrit. Just as Latin is not derived from Greek, so
Greek and Latin are not derived from Sanskrit. Both on
the contrary, along with most of the languages of modern
Europe and some of those of Asia, spring from one original
mother-tongue, long since extinct, which in this book is
