thought, e.g. ᾔδεε ydp ἀδελφῶν ὣς ἐπονεῖτο (Homer); Quid
censes hunc ajorum S. Roscr'mn quo studeo esse, etc. (Cicero).

The accusative ol the Intesnal Object repeats the meaning Intereat.
of the verb in a greater or less degree and may be described
as adverbial. Sometimes, for instance, the accusative limits
the meaning ol the verb to the part affected, e. g. ἀλγεῖ τὴν
κεφαλήν, Tremit artus, the so-called accusative of Respect.
From parts of the body this use ol the accusative is extended
to other conditione, eg. εὖ εἶχον τὰς ψυχάς. Itis also found
with nouns as well as verbs, e. g. βοὴν ἀγαθός, hirsuta capillos.
First ol all it was used with the verb, e. g. ἔοικα, theu with the
verbal noun, eg. ἐοικώς, and then with the adjective oi cognate
meaning, eg. ἶσος. In Latin this accusative is explained as
a Graecism, but wrongly, sor the usage is inherited from the
original language· In Sanskrit it is rare but occurs with

, πάντα, as in Greek with ὄνομα. Itis not hard to see how this
accusative, though original, fell into comparative disuse in
Latin and Sanskrit‚ lor other cases took its place. Thus even '
in Greek we find εὐρύτερος ὤμοισιν, where the dative takes the
place ol the acc, while in Sanskrit the instrumentalis pre·
ferred and in Latin the ablative.

The so-called Cognate Accusative must like the Accusative
of Respect be regarded as an adverbial use ol the case in a
defining and qualifying sense. Such phrases as ludum ludere,
πολεμον πολεμίζειν are to be explained in the same way as ὴδὺ
γελᾶν, perfidum ridens, viz. the accusative qualifies the verb as
an adverb. In such a phrase as ἄλληκτον πολεμίζειν (lo war
uncean'ngly) we need not suppose an ellipse ol πολεμον, for the
use of πολεμον needs just as much explanation as that ol
ἄλληκτον and must be explained in the same way. In both
Greek and Latin there are many neuter adjectives and pro-
nouns used as adverbial accusatives, eg. σμικρόν τι, οὐδέν,
ἀμφότερον, quantum, parurn, id aetatz's, and many more. As
adverbial accusatives must also be ranked the accusatives of
space and time, which need not be illustrated. Adverbial
