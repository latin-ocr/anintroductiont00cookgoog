204 Parataxis. [cn.

Μικλεφ λύπην napa-Pars rubim feretro, triste miniterium.
In the former case we may remark that the developed lan-
guage adopts in such phrases amore elaborate form ol
expression, indicating the subsidiary character of the clause
in apposition by introducing it with ut or quod. As it stands
the instance given corresponds to a possible Memini,· ego
audibi, where the last clause, though logically, is not gram-

matically subordinate. Grammatical subordination is a later
development and expressed by the accusative and infinitive.

Paralaxis and Hypolams.

Parataxis That coordination or paraturis of clauses precedes subor-

333ῌῖΡῦ dination or hypotaxis has become a common-place. We

cannot, however, suppose that hypotaxis is ol recent origin in
language; foras lar as we can go back in the history of
human speech, we find the degradation of sentences to a
completely subordinate position sully established. Nor, again,
is it true to say that the hypotactic constructions differ in
nothing from the paratactic except that two sentences origin-
ally distinct have been fused into one. It may be the lact
that the earliest forms of hypotaxis are not grammateially
distinct lrom those of parataxis, licet: venat becomes licet
uento! with no further change except that whereas orig-
inally we had two sentences now we have merely one.
But from the logical point of view in an aggregate ol sen·
tences or clauses some one or more must contain the main
facts, to which the statements in the other clauses are
variously related as cause, result, condition, etc. ln narra-
tive the accessory character of some clauses is osten indi-
cated by the use of the relative tenses, the imperfect or
pluperlect, contrasting with the present or aorist in the
principal clause, e. g. :—

Ἐδοξε τῇ βούλῃ καὶ τῷδήμῳ· Κεκροπὶε ἐπρυτάνευε, Μνησίθεος
ἐγραμμάτευε, Εὐπείθης ἐπεστάτει, Καλλίας εἶπε.
