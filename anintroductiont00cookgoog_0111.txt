alternation of two long vowels in Amo, Anz'e'm's. Mostly
however some one vowel is preserved throughout, though
cognate forms often shew different degrees of the suffix,
eg. altmom'um, alimentum, alumnus ,· termo, tormen, termrnus.

It is characteristic of Latin to employ certain suffixes to
give definiteness to forms which might otherwise be obscure.
Thus the neuters in -men are amplified by a suffix -lo and
we get cognomentum by the side of cognomen. The feminines
similarly take a suffix -c (in or'clrr2x) or -a (in autor-a as
compared with ἢὼς, Aeol. αὕως, which is an S-stem), to indicate
their, gender. From the neuter stems in -os, -er corres-
ponding to the type γένος we get in Latin a group ol
masculines formed with long o carried throughout, and
decor, honos stand beside decus, frenes-tus. Similarly termo
and formamus are only two different ways of forming a
masculine from the original neuter tormen (τέρμα).

Mure stemr belong to the Strong inflexion, but scarcely Mute
any traces of stem variation are left. For instance, instems.
Sanskrit we find dioran, acc. dodrantem, gen. oneratas, but
in Greek φέρων, acc. φέροντα, gen. φέροντος with the same stem
throughout. In χαρίεις, siem xoptfevr·‚ we find the fem.
χαρίεσσα sor yuptferto (not yoptfevryu which would become
χαριεισα). Properly the stem should be masc. yaprfm- fern.
yaprfgrr-ya, which last should give χαριασσα, but the ε vowel
of the masc. has taken the place of α.

In Latin, vowel variation in mute-stems is unknown, one
form of the root being extended to all caseS, e. g. dric- in
deiros, re'g- in rc'gzr. The chief point to notice is that all
present participles have passed into I·stems in the neuter
nom. and in the gen. plural (serentemferentem, poet. -um,
as compared with φέροντα, φερόντων). The present parti-
ciples have the weak stem everywhere, as contrasted with
the strong stem in Greek, but -z'ens, euntia isa solitary case
’ of vowel variation. The strong stem is however seen insons
