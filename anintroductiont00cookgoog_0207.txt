b] The subjunctive. 195

setting as he is bound to (fut. indic.) in the course of nature,
he will shine among the dead. This meaning is appropriate
to the first pers. alone. In the first pers. plur. we have the
hortatory use of the mood, e. g. φεύγωμεν, let us fly, which is
equivalent to an imperative. In Latin the usage with the
first sing. is unknown, though it is possible that the passage
of some forms of the subjunctive (like regam, oudtbm) to the
future indic. may be due to this usage. With the first plur. it
ts common.

ln the and and 3rd pers the subjunctive still expresses
the will of the speaker, but as addressed to someone else, it
implies that that person is to perform it, i.e. it becomes a
command, e.g. φέρ’, ὦ τέκνον, νῦν καὶ τὸ τῆς νήσου μάθῃς (soph),
or as in an Elean inscription τὸ (tempu ἀνατεθᾷ ἐν τὸ ἱερόν,
both of which are quite rare idioms in affirmative sentences
in Greek as compared with Sanskrit and Latin, e. g. factet,
let lrzin do. Latin even bya peculiar idiom extends the usage
to the past tenses of the subjunctive, which then become a
command with reference toa past event, i.e. according to
our idiom a statement of what it was desirable should be
done, eg. tirtz'latus erres ipsum Voconium, you should boue
followed tlte example ‘ff V. This is called the Jussive use.

2. With μή in prohibitive sentences, e. g. μή σε κιχείω (Homer), lffrohibi-
εει that I do noifindyou, μὴ ἐάσῃς, do not allow (trever with uve·
the present in classical Greek) and μὴ τοῦτό γε νεῖκος γεἰηται
(Homer), I do not weil thri to be a quarrel.

The Latin usage does not differ, except thar classical
Latin in prohibitions addressed to a definite person uses the
perfect subjunctive. This tense etymologically seems to be
optative (p. 157), but nevertheless nefacerzi was felt as a com·
mand not a wish.

Greek by scarcely ever using the and end 3rd pers. subj. in en impera·
tire sense in affirmative sentences preserved a distinction between the
subjunctive and imperative. In prohibitions the subjunctive was used;
for, as we have seen (p. 144), the imperative was not originally the
mood so employed.
