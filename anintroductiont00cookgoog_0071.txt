This alternation has not yet been explained.

Srrrrnnrs are sounds in the utterance of which the mouth Spirants
charmel is so far narrowed that the stream of breath sounds
against the sides of the passage. They consist of the hard
dental spirant s and the soft ες the soft palatal spirant y (or j);
the labial spirant w, in Greek f, which cannot be distinguished
from the consonantal p.

The soft spirant z is usually represented in Greek by the The Sibi-
same symbol σ as the hard s. In the dialects however we pannsand
find it sometimes represented by ζ, in ψήφιζμα, κόζμος. The
nature of the spirant depends on the following sound. Before
hard sounds it iss, before soft sounds it is z.

Initial hards remains before consonants:

σκῦτος, scutum3 σκάπτειν, scabics; tarega, stella for *ster-lm
στατός, status.

Initial sbefore vowels becomes in Greek the hard breathing‚
in Latin remains s:

ἕδος, scdc03 ἅρπη, sarp03 ἑπτά, reptem ἔπεσθαι, sequen elya, semi-3
ἡγεῖσθαι, sagr're, praesagum ἕνος (ἕνη καὶ νέα), senex.

Initial σ before vowels in Greek, where it remeius is the
relic of a group of consonants, eg. σεύωεσ-σευω tsqp'ery,
σέβομαι = ηεβομαι, coherio = ofohevo. Sometimes initial
cf = sp is represented in Greek by the rough breathing,
e. g. ἡδύς :spari-oe, ἔξ :spekn

Medial hard s remains before consonants (ks, gr, written

ξ, x),
ὲσ-τί, es-t; ἐξ, ex; ἀξὼν, axes.
Between vowels in Greek, σ becomes the rough breathing

and disappears: where it remains it
(Ι) is the seduction Of σσ, e. g. yre'rror: μέσσος.
