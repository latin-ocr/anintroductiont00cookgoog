Ft'rsl Plural Mc'ddlc.
Finst plur. Termination -μεθα, Sanskrit -mohc There is also in Greek
mldd' the form -μεσθα, Which appears ln Epic ἱκόμεσθα, γενόμεσθα,
etc„ and in Tragic poetry.

Second Plural Mz'ddlc.

· Second Tennination ·θε, e. g. ῆσ-θε. We find in Sanskrit-dha lor

plur. nslidd'primary, -dhvom for secondary ending. There is an unex-
plained difference between the final vowel in Greek and
Sanskn't.

The ο of -σθε, as in φέρε-σ-θε, is not original. Originally
appearing only in stems ending in σ or a dental, it has passed
hy analogy into all other stems. Thus in ἦο-θε, henoc-dc the
σ is regular, but not so in λέγε-σ-θε, φέρεσθεΙ

Third Plurol Middlc.
Third plur. (1) Primary endings -νται, -αται (ἤτοι) :· -φὲρο-νται, Sanskrit
midd' bddranleJ εἵ-ατιιι (ἥαται), Sanskrit lisele.
The rule is that -αται, -aro should appear aster consonants
and ι and υ, but -νται, -ντο alter vowels.
Thus from pf. stems ending in a consonant we have
τετάχ-αται, τετράφαται, and after ι the Epic κεκλί-αται, nei-aroc
(κεά-ται), but also βεβλὴ-οται. ln Dorlc γεγράψαται there isan
ending -σαται, which may be compared with the -σοσι ol εἴξασι.
(a) Secondary ending, -ντο, -ατο (ατο) ε-ἐφέρο-ντο, Sanskrit
obharanlo3 εἴ-οτο (ἥατο), Sanskrit cisalo.

‘ Apart from the Indicative, -ατο appears as ending ol the
optative Mood, e. g. γενοίατο, ἀπολοίατο, This ending is
regular in Homer.

Besore -αται, -aro gutturals and labials were aspirated, e. g.
ε’τετθχ-ατο, τεθάφαται, but not dentals, as in κεχωρίδ-αται, ἀγω-

vid-orac.
