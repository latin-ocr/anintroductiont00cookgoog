. The Radical or Monosyllabic tanguages, like Chinese, use

roots as independent words, which depend for their mmning ἶ

upon their position in the sentence. In such languages
we find no formai distinction of the parts of speech, no
inflexion, no derivation. Tbey form a srnall minority of

' &1535ng the Radical and the fully Inflexional languages

¹ ' come the Agglutinative languages, approximating in varying ἵ

degrees to one or other of the two extreme types. The
characteristic of the Agglutinative languageS, as a body, is
that the roots do not remain apart as independent words as

in Chinese, but yet do not combine so fixedly as in the

Inflexional languages. Is roots are combined, one bears the
leading idea and the others tend to lose their individual
meaning, but the combinations can be taken apart more
readily than in Inflexional languages. As however the fusion
of the elements os words is aquestion oi degree, we can draw
no hard and fast line between Agglutinative and Inflexional

languages.
