36 y Indo-European O. [cn.

Indo-European long o· = Greek ω, Latin ὁ.

δῶρον, do'num3 νῶΐ, ndu γι-γνόνσιεω, (g)ndsco; dre-ir, ‹ic-ion κρώζω,
crcicio ς btv, ovum πῶ-μα, poculum, pri-tun ρὡννυμι, rd-bur.

&sometimes appears in isolated cases in Latin as 123 cf.
da-trir-us beside datirfitr beside φώρ, haic sor bid-ce. This
change is unexplained.

Indo-European oy· = Greek οι.

, e. g. οΙνή, chroco-a, hard-s.

The ¹. diphthong oi existed in early Latin, and is found in
inscriptions in words like oz'rzvorsei(umbersz). In later Latin
it passed into oe and then generally into τὶ, and so we get
successively the forms oenus and unus. But in some words
the change to ri never took place (e. g. poena); in other cases
the fonns with ri exist side by side with those with oe (poenin
and punire, Punicus and Poenus).

ln one or two cases an original oi seems to be represented
in Latin by ῑ, e. g. fidus (cl. πέ-ποιθ-α), viius (fateor), vritum
(fulvos). So in final unaccented syllables ioli answers to rol
and cquis to ἵπποις.

Indo-European op = Greek ου.

e. g. βοῦ-ς, caol-o, horici.

The Secondary ov, which arose from contraction, etc.
(p. 66), was, like Secondary ει, originally distinct from the
true diphthong and a narrower and less open sound than ω.

The diphthong ou is never original in Latin. It is true
that we find bovis corresponding to βοός and ovis to 3wa
but bovis may rather come from a genitive ἕψε, which would
seem to be the correct form (see p. 54), and in any case the
b in Latin is irregulares representing a Greek β coming
from a velar guttural (p. 54). ovis again cannot represent ὄις,
the root ol which perhaps rather appears in ‹zv-ena, ‹zv-illa.

Indo-Euro· Indo-European ἵε Greek ἵ, Latin ἴ.
