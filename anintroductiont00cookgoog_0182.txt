cau trace changes of gender to the influence 01 analogy.
For instance, δρόσος has been assimilated in gender to ἕρσῃ
from similarity 01 meaning.

Like Sanskrit and Greek the original Indo-European lan- '
guage had three numbers, Sritgulm, Dual, and Plural. Ο1
these Latin has lost the dual except in isolated words, such
as ambo. In all these languages there are sometimes differ· 1
00003 03 regards number between the form and meaning 01 0 1
word. For instance, the singular is sometimes used iu a 1
collective sense with common nameS, e. g. ὁσσλέρισς, hostes, 1
the enemy; eques, cavalry. The singular is also used where a 1
single member istaken as typical of a class, 0. g. ὁ Λάκων, 1
Romanus, 00010 abstract sentences such as Man is morial. 1
The plural number is sometimes used collectively‚ and 1
regarded as a unity, and not as 0 number 01 distinct things,
as for instance when in English we say Another len shr'llr'ergn
or in Latin anacastra. A bow, lor instance, may be looked
on as a whole consisting 01 partS, 0, g. τόξα 10 Homer, and
similarly δώματα (horae), ρέγσρσ, ἃρμσσσ, etc. ln the same
way we find the plural used 01 0 01033 01 natural objects,
e. g. κύρσσσ, ἄστρα, ῥέεθρα, andos parts 01 the body, 0. g. νῶτα,
στήθεα, πρόσωπα.
The Dual number is only found in Latin in isolated words
such as ambo, duo, but in Sanskrit it is extensively employed,
though in Greek it has become obsolete except in Homer
and the Attic dialect. The Indo-European usage then must
be determined from a comparison 01 Greek and Sanskrit. In
these languages we find the dual used 01 things which go
naturally in pairs, e. g. ὄσσε, tlte eyes, πόδε, thefeel, ἵππω, 0 pur'r
cyborum while, where two things only come together fora
special time or circumstance, the dualis more rare. Iu
Greek it must be admitted that the plural also is used 01
things which go in pairS, as for instance ἐν χερσὶν ἔθηκεν and
ὄφθσλρσῖσιν ὁρᾶν. Either the plural has been extended at the
