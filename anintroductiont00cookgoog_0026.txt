14 Greek and Lahir, [ch.

our special attention, were once probably neighboun'ng
dialects of the common speech, justas they afterwards
became neighbours in Europe. They arethe only Indo-
European languages which have seminines of the O·declen-
sion, and their systems os accentuation are to some extent
the same.

On the other hand, though the structure and vocabulary
of Latin at first sight seems to connect it most closely with
the Greek languages, it maybe noticed that the two most
characteristic points in the Latin verb—the future in -b- and
the passive in -r—find their counterpart not in Greek but in
Celtic, while much of the vocabulary common to Latin and
Greek is also common to the other Indo-European lan-
guages, and on the other hand many of the names of the
commonest objects have a different origin in the two lan-
guages, e. g. the names for sca, earth, sky. We have already
seen that it is dangerous to attempt to determine too exaetly
the mutual relations of allied tongues, and we can only say
that the evidence does not at present justify us in assuming
that either Greeks and Italians or Celts and Italians ever
formed one people distinct from the other members of the
common Indo-European stock.

standon quite a different footing to the relations in which
the vulgar Latin or Lingua Romana of the provinces of the
Roman empire stands to the modern Romance languages.
The Romance languages are directly descended from the
Lingua Romana, just as the Indo-European languages are
descended from a primitive Indo-European speech. But we
can prove the descent of the Romance languages from the
Lingua Romana by historical inquiry. Both the mother tongue
and the descendants are before us. The original Indo-Euro-
pean, on the other hand, from which Greek, Latin, Sanskrit,
and the other Indo-European languages have descended,
no longer existe. We have to reconstruct it out of the simi--
