optative is akin to the future indicative rather than the
imperative.

The potential uses ol the subjunctive in Latin, e. g. Id veliin
mr'hi agnoscas, I could wish ; Jam mallem Cerberum metueres.
I could have preferred ,· delrerrin, etc, are not different to those
of Greek except in the absence oia qualiiying particle. The
mood which we call the subjunctive in Latin is really both
in form and meaning a compound mood. It contains some
tenses that etymologioelly are optative, eg. stin, suntin,

idiomatic μὴ κλέψῃς represents the earlier form of prohibition,
while μὴ κλέπτε represents an extension of the imperative
from its use in commands to a use in prohibitions. The use
ol the imperative in Latin calls for no special remark,
beyond the fact that there is an increasing tendency in the
language to substitute a subjunctive or a periphrasis sor the
negative with the imperative. In classica] times ne saeviis

Indicative. The Indicative is primarily the mood of simple assertion.
From this it is extended to negative and interrogative sen·
tenees. Further the indicative is used in Sanskrit, Greek,
and Latin, and other languages to express suppositiou, eg.
