and a stressed syllable tends to be also pronounced in a
higher key. But the connexion between these two kinds of
accentS, and the relation in which they stand to the quantity
of a syllable is too obscure a subject to be discussed here.

The most striking illustration of the importance of accent
in language is that great discovery known from its author's
name as Verner’s law, which is only second in importanee
to the law that it supplements which goes by the name of
Grimm’s law.

Grimm's law is a statement of the relations which exist Grimm's
between the mute consonants in three groups of languages— law.

High German. The law is usually stated as follows: Where

Into the details of this law it is not necessary to go, as it
has nothing to do with the subject of this book. But we
may notice that it is complicated by the fact that the German
languages have no aspirated consonants and substitute for
them the corresponding spirants (d, ihs), and that in the
labial series considerable confusion has taken place between

explained by the following modification-that Grimm’s law
is true of initial mutes and those that occur in an originally
accented syllable; but that in a syllable originally unacceuted
the hard mutes of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin are represented
by the corresponding soft mutes in Low German, e. g. Anglo—
Saxon and English. For the purposes of this law, conso·
