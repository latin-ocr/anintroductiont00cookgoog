v.] The Hard Velar. 51

generally appears in Greek in cases where other related
words represent the velar by π before the full vowel o.
Thus assuming an original Ναὶ (to move) we have in
Greek ult-lo, but also πόλ-οπ, while in Sanskrit we find only

car-ati (he moves) answering to both.
II. kl becomes in Greek π before the full vowel o (ω), and Before o.

before r, θ, σ, liquids and nasals. In Latin we find qu, etc.
sometimes becoming c.
In the following instances we get τ before r, r, but π before
ο, etc. in connected words in Greek.
