5⁸ ¹Liquids and Nasals. [cu.

The liquid l, where non-sonant, is unchanged in Greek
and Latin, except so far as it alternates with νς and we
need give only a few instances.

In Greek a prothetic vowel often appears :-

l-haxdr. fevir; λύω, duo, ro-lvo; λούω, hvo3 λέγω, lego.

Indo-European r is unchanged, but when initial always has
a prothetic vowel in Greek. Few instances are required.

ἅρ-θρον, ἀραρίσνω, ar·mus, artur, ar-mcntum3 ἀράχνῃ, aranea:
ἀρόω, ἄρουρα, aro, arvum dud-fepce, verrem ὅρ-ννμι, oriam ὁρόω,
vereor.

lt cannot perhaps be decided whether the original language
possessed both the liquids r and lor not; but if not, the
balance of evidence is in favour of supposing r to be the
original and la subsequently developed sound.

TheNasals. Indo-European n is unchanged in Greek and Latin, and
· requires but little illustration.

ἄνεμος, animus; γένυς, gena; εἶνατέρες, janitrices; ἐνί, εἰν, ἓν, in,
in·ter; ἐννέα, novem.

Indo-European m is unchanged in Greek and Latin.

ploos (ped-yos), medium μήν, mensis3 μήτηρ, maten μίγ-νυμι, misceo
(magr-mk μορμύρω, murmur; μυῖα (pua-ga), ntus-ca.

The nasal followed by a consonant is always assimilated
to the character of that consonant; eg. it is guttural in
queisque, ἐγκαλέω, dental in ἐντιλλω, labial in ἐμποδών. This is
shewn even in the combination of distinct words; eg. candem
and the pronunciation of τὴμ πόλιν, ely κόλπον, which is the
spelling found in old inscriptions.

Alterna- We may notice that there are some cases in which hard

fflf’gost, and soft or soft and aspirated consonants seem to alternate

and aspi· in the same root, mostly when they are the final letters of a

rated ⁶⁰¹¹· stem. Thus we find:
sonants

’ἦΎ-ννμι, pango, compages beside paciscor, pax.
*cabo ‚, σκαπάνη,
lssffibi’ „ λαπάζειν.
