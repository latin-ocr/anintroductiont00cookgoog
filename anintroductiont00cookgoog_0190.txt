178 The Genitive. [cn.

again is the use of tbe accusative in apposition to the rest of
the sentence, eg. χάριν, πρόφασιν, oriem, or in such a sentence
as Pars urgenti subare feretra, {risle mrirrsterium (Virg.).

Verbs which are constructed with a double accusative
· have one os the external, one oi the internal object The
internal goes closely with the verb, e. g. κακὰ-ῥέζει and forms a
new verbal notion with which an external accusative is con-
structed, e. g. κακὰ-ῥέζει τινα. ln Latin this construction is
rare except with a neuter prououn as the internal accusative.
Such phrases as rogare populum coarsulenr are evidently early
extensions ol the construction which survive only as technical
idioms.

The construction of the accusative after the past partic. in

Latin, confined mostly to the poets, falls under two heads:
(r) where the particis plainly middle the case is the ordinary

external acc, e. g. unum exserta latus, (a) where the partic. is
passive, the accusative is internal and adverbial, e. g. per pedes
trajectus lora.

As with the Accusative the starting-point was the construc-
tion with verbs, so with the Genitive the starting-point is the
construction with nouus. As the acc. was primarily adverbial,
so the genitive is adnominal. The Greek name of the case
was γενικὴ ol which the Latin rendering 'was Gentibus, but
this would rather point to a Greek γεννητική, or case os origin.
The γενικὴ πτῶσις was the case of the γένος, eg. in τοῦ ζῴου τὸ
μὲν θνητόν κ.τ.λ. the genitive represents the γένος or larger class
os animals, while the noun to which it is attached represents
the species, or smaller class mortal. The connexion os the
genitive with the noun with which it goes is close, but the
nature ol the connexion can only be determined by the
meaning of the sentence. The relation ior instance may be
that of possessor to possessed, cause to effect, part to whole, etc,
and in different languages there are differences of idiom. We
will now consider what uses of the true genitive may be
