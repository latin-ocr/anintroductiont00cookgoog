102 Comparison. [cn.

Secondary Secondary suffixes are, lor the comparative -reprr, Slr. -tara-,
Βῶκες· and for the superlative -τατο-.

The suffixes -το, -aro are found in the ordinals, e. g. τρῖ-τος,
with a superlative meaning in πῦμ-ατος, dar-aroc, ἔσχ-ατος, and
combined with the ordinal suffix ln rpl-r-aros, ἑβδόμ-ατος. Of
these the suffix -aro- is perhaps due to the analogy of the
ordinals τέτρα-τος, ἕνα-τος, δέκα-τος, where the a is part of the
stem. The superlative suffix -τατο- is a Greek formation and
is a combination of the two suffixes w and -ar0·.

An accumulation of the suffixes of comparison is to be
seen in &wip-repas, irrr-e‘p-rep-oe‚ >lapsuri-repas (cf. Lat.
inf-er-zar).

The suffixes -τερο-, ‹aro- are added either to the stem, as
in ὠμά-τερος, ἀληθέσηατος, or to case forms, as lor instance to
the locative in natat-repon μυχοί-τως. The difference
between -ωτερος, -ωτατος, and -οτερος, -οτατος, if not merely
metricat can be explained by supposing that the long vowels
come from cases (abl. or instr.) in -ω, e. g. σοφώ-τερος (p 104).

Other suffixes of comparison are to be seen in {arpa (cs.
Lat. mseras, sup-erus), and apd-pus (cf. prelatus, ultimus).

Compari- The termination of comparatives in Latinis -ios, -ies,

{iiiios -is, as shewn above. The forms present no special diffi-

in Latin. culty, but mz'nus is better taken to be an old neuter suh
stantive mainus, *mineris (cf. Old Lat nither-rmus, manti-ter,
etc), which, when used at first in apposition‚ and eventually
adjectivally, got a new' masculine form mahar (cf. denes beside
decor).

Other comparative suffixes are -lero in exterus, posterus, and
-ero, which appears with a second suffix in ahsertar, superior.

The superlative suffixes are (ι) -mo in pransus, sum-mus,
extre-mus, bru-ma (ὄνῳ-πα) ; (a) -lumo, -timo in esc-timus,
acl-trinus, pos-tumus; (3) -simus in mammas, plu-rainuasacil·
hirtus. The addition of this suffix to the reduced sorm -z's·
os the comparative suffix dos· gives the ordinary termination
arsamus.
