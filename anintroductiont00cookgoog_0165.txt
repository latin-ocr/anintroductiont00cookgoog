(b) Aorist presents formed with the weak root :- dgo, cilo,
caino, crido, liquor, nivzl,srirere‚ timido, etc.

(a) Verbs forming the present stem with the reduced root
reduplicated. Latin makes no distinction between the
thematic and non-thematic verbs. giga-0 (Old Lat. geno,
cf. genuus), sido (srsssd-o), disco (dide-sco), mat-o, hatho, sero
(sis-0).

(3) T-class, formed by adding t before the thematic
vowel.

Imperfect Presents 2—flec-to‚ pec-to, tri-ro (ver'd-to), etc.

Aorist Presents :—ffi·teor (sinisii-rica (cf. χά-σκω).

Here we must put boetem, which the compounds re-bitere,
eto, show to be originally diphthongal.

(4) Nasal Class. Ι

(α) Those in which the suffix no, ne is added to the root, ⁸
originally in its reduced form. These were originally non·
thematic, and correspond to the 5th or 9th Sanskrit class,
which are formed by adding ·no- or -ηᾶ- (plur. nu, ni, I.·E.
ψ) to the wealr root. They would have passed into the
thematic system in the way indicated above (p. 150). Both
sper-nci-mus and sper-mt-mus would produce spernemus, and
this sperma, spernit.

Cer-no (κμί-νω, cf. p. 135), ster-no, sper-no, tem-no, zh-clztno,
co-nor, desti-no, lano, σι’-κο. Disguised by assimilation, -follo
(tl-no), pello, vellafallo.

(b) The nasal is ‘infixed' appearing in the body of the
root which is reduced. These verbs correspond to the sk.
yth class of the type rundh from the drudo. In Greek
this type only appears with a second suffixed nasal (λα-μ-β·
ria-o aliod, p. 135).

Jf-n·do‚ scm-do, pun-go, ru-m·p0‚ r'n-cu-m-bo, nin-guel,
etc. In some verbs (tic-n-gafum-gorl the nasal appears in
all forms but in the majority of cases is confined to the
present system.
