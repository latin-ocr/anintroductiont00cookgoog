01 1 vowel. To these liquids r and l when used 11 vowels 1

we give the name 01 Liquid Sonants. They existed not only in

'Sanskrit but also in the original Indo-European language,

and traces 01 them can be found in all branches 01 the Indo-

European family. ¹
But while in Sanskrit the vowel-sound 01 the liquid is not

written, in the other languages it is written. This vowel-sound

01 the Liquids when used as vowels did not find the same

equivalent in the alphabets 01 the different nations: each re

presented it by 11111 vowel. or combination 01 vowels‚ which it

seemed to thern most to resemble. When, therefore, we find

in Greek καρδί-α, in Latin cordas, in Gothic 1111111110 must

not conclude that a Greek a answers toa Latin o and Gothic

αι’, but that the vowels in the three languages differ because

the vowel-sound 01 the liquid sonant, not finding its exact
equivalent in any alphabet, was differently represented in

each.

The Liquid The Liquid Sonants (g, g) were represented in Greek and

Sonants. Latin as follows:
g Ξ Gk· α111 pss, Lat· or

We cannot teli so clearly from a single language 11 from a
comparison 01 more than one whether any os these sounds in
Greek and Latin represents a Liquid Sonant. Thus in the
case 01 ἄλλος there is no other wo'rd in Greek which would
help us to determine whether αλ stands 101 original g. But
the Latin 111-1111 shows that αλ 11 an original sound inherited
by both languages‚ and that we might write the original 1.-Ε.

with the Latin cordrls, shows by the disagreement 01 the
vowels that both correspond to an original kgdi.
