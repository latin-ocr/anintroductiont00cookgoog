118 Numeral . [cn.

Τ wently. Sk. adipati, Gk. thart, εἴκοσι, Lat. argrini. The 3

Doric εἲκατι may stand for frangam, and the ο of εἴκοσι come
from the ordinal εἶκοστος (iinon-ros). The origin of the first
syllable is obscure. The example ol the German languages
would lead us to look sor a compound oi which the first
element signifies ‘two ;' but though dpi- alter a vowel in

Latin might become pel, as suadpzt· becomes suavis, this will ᾖ
not account sor the Greek and Sanskrit sorms. Theg of η

the Latin is also unexplained, though it may be due to the l
following n. ¹

The higher numerals are formed by the addition in Greek ,

of -κοντα, in Latin ol gzizla, to the simple numeral, but

always with a long vowel preceding the termination. ὀγδοή- “

κοντα seems earlier than octogtitta, os which a bye-form
octuaginta exists, which has influenced the form of septua-

ginta. This is only one of the many cases oi the influence p
os assimilation and analogy, which, as we should expect, is 3
specially common in the numerals. But in most cases its ³

working is so obvious as not to require illustration. ⁴

Hundred. I.-E. kgtim, Gk. ἑκατόν, Lat. centum. The prefix l
in Greek is unexplained. The suffix ·tizgenti which is so l

largely used to form the multiples in Latin originales with
forms like septingenti (septgtkgrlz‘). The Greek suffix -κοσωι
corresponds to the Sk. -fatya (Dor. marroc) but has the vowel
of-xovra.

The Gk. xhtot (in Hom. -χΐλοι) goes back to a stem ytalie,
Sk. saddsra, Dor. χὴλιοι, Aeol. χελλιοι, which should strictly
in Attic become χείλιοι. Mille, milia may be akin to μύριοι,

The numerals in the other series may be treated more
briefly.

πρῶτος, Dor. πρᾶτος, is superlative in form, like primus.
δεύτερος has nothing to do with δύω, but is related to δεὺομω
as secundus to sequor. ἕβδομ-ος, septim-us, decem-ur shew the
original final nasal of the stem, the suffix being simply -ος,
which in δέκατος has been supplanted by -τος,
