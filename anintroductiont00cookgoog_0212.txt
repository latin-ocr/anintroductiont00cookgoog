infinitivo, We have already spoken'ot the substantival origin ol the
Infinitive. Its sense as the dative ol an abstract noun
remains in Greek, especially in Homer, e.g. λεῖπε pop-jac ¹ss
sor corrytirg, and in the somlled epexegetic infinitivus ln
the Latin poets we sometimes find the primitive use, eg. Ibat
et hirsutas ille otiiereferas (Properti From being a word ol
limitation attached to the main verb the infinitive came to be
in sense the subject ol a sentence. In impersonal sentences
the subject was vagae and the infinitive took its place, e. g. n’e¹
μὲν γάρ τι κακὸν βασιλευέμεν (Homer), itis no bad theirg to reign,
passing into to reign is no bod thing. In later Greek, by the
addition of the article, e. g. τὸ βασιλεύειν, the infinitive passes
into a substantive employed in all the cases. The infinitive
can also serve as the object ol the sentence and out oi this
was developed, as we shall see, the idiom ol the Accusative
and the Infinitive.

Concord in Now that we have spoken of the use ol the llloods in ἵ

prospice- simple sentences we will deal with the syntax ol Concord.
concord ,nThe agreement osa predicative word, in gender, number, l
gender. case or person with the subject of the sentence arose first in
sentences in which the predicate was identical and lelt to be
convertible with the subject. Subject and predicate were
therefore assimilated to one another, and this agreement was
extended by analogy to other cases where the relation be-
tween subject and predicate was different. Il', for instance,
we say, ‘T tis is lhcjustr'ce ‘ff the gods,' there can be no doubt
that ‘than' indicating something which is only made intelli-
gible by the addition nithe predicate, will naturally stand in
the neuter, singular or plural. Nevertheless, as early as
Homer, we find αὕτη τοι δίκη ἐστι θεῶν, where the predicate
has been made conformable to the subject, because in this
type ol sentence subject and predicate are coextensive.
