uses were transferred to the Genitive. Lastly, the Locative was
replaced by the Dative, which in Greek had already swallowed
the Instrumental. We thus see that it is a matter of history
to determine the uses which went with each case in different
languages·
Is it possible to discover a single principle underlying the
⁰ · various uses of each case? It has been supposed that the
cases denoted in the first instance relations of space, and were
afterwards gradually extended to the expression of more in-
tellectual and abstract relations. Under the head of Unde
(place whence) will come the Nominative‚ the case of the

subject from which the action starts, and also the Ablative‚
which expresses origin and separation, and the Greek Genitive

so far as it expresses ablatival meanings. Of the other uses
the Accusative is tbe case of the object and will come under
Quo (place whtlher), but this does not explain all the cases of
the Accusative in Greek or Latin. Nor again can all the
uses of the Dative be explained by referring them to Ubi
(place where), or the chief uses of the Genitive by referring
them to Unde. The Local theory of the cases, as it has been
called, is then insufficient to explain all the different cases.
Loeal and We may broadly distinguish cases into Local and Gram-
gffifi' martial. What is meant by local we have already defined. ¹
Grammatical cases express relations which belong to
the syntax of the sentence. If we go back to the period
when eight cases existed in Latin and Greek as in
Sanskrit, the classification is clearer. The Ablative and ,
Locative are alone in origin local cases; the Nom, Ace,
Gen, Dat, and Instrumental are grammatical. Of these
last the Genitive is in some of its usages at any rate t
adnominal, further defining the meaning of a noun, while the
other four may be classed together as adverbial, all serving in
some way or other to limit and modify the action of the verb.
