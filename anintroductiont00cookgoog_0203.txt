perfect. Sometimes the two tenses are combined, as for
instance in the common legal formula ἐάοξττῇ βουλῇ, Knemis
ἐπρυτάνευε eet, where the main fact is put in the aon'st and
the accompanying minor details in the imperfect. This is
also the normal usage in Latin, the main fact being expressed
by the aorist perfect, the accessory circumstances being put
in the imperfect or pluperfect. The aorist in similes and
proverbs has a timeless use, e. g. tls τε λέον ἐχάρη, a usage also
found in Latin poetry. When employed in subordinate sen-
tences the time denoted by the aorist is relative to that of the
principal verb, as for instance in ἐτράποντο ὅθεν ἀνηγάγοντο, eo
postquam Caesar pervenit, arma poposcit, we translate the
subordinate aorists by pluperfects. Such meanings do not
belong to the aorist itself, but are due to its conjunction with
the rest of the sentence.

As to the character of the action denoted by the aorist-
stem in all the different moods, it is momentary as opposed
to what is contabuerat, e.g. ἐδάκρυσε, he burst into teors, and
denotes the result as opposed to the process, eg. ἔπεισε,
persuasit, he convinced. When an artist wished to lay stress
on the simple fact that he was the author of a work of art, he
inscribed eratque: when he wished to imply that he had spent
labour on its productiori, he wrote ἐποίει. It is possible that
the different shades of meaning denoted hythe aorist may
once have belonged to its different stems. The sigmatic
aorist, for instance, may have denoted the moment of entering
upon an action or condition, e. g. ἐβασίλευσε, lu began to reign,
while the thematic aorist may have denoted the result, eg.
πεσεῖν, to fall. But of this there is no proof.

A use of the aorist which we must regard as inherited
from the original language is its use, especially in Homer and
tragedy, to denote au event which has just taken place, eg.
e’srgjveo’ ἔργον καὶ πρόνοιαν, Ι must approvc, etc„ and this use is to
be found in Sanskrit.

The moods of the aorist denote past time only when they
