λλ] The Labzals. Δ 57

A Greek word containing π was sometimes transiiterated
in Latin by b: thus Ennius used Bruges, Burrus to represent
Φρύγες, Πορρός. So in Latin we have an interchange of p
and b in potus beside bibo (sk. ρι’ὀᾶνιί), etc.

The sofr labial b seems to have been almost unknown in
the original language. It is very rare in Sanskrit; though
common in Greek, it there originates mostly from g, f, οτμ
before a liquid; it is uncommon in Latin, except as the
representative of medial dh near r, medial bh or initial dp.

It may be original in μόλυβδος, plumbum: aldeb, ὀ-λιβρός, lubn'cus,
Eng. slip3 τύρβη, turba, Eng. thorp3 λόβος, Eng. lep-eared.

β is a merely euphonic insertion between μ and λ or ρ in

⁸ ave-evron veneror—manentia, ἡνίνι-νέν-β-λετω, etvibrat-
ἅμ-β-ροτος, βροτός, dial. μορτός-μέμ-β-λωοο, {ponor-Aperensem.
ἀμ-β-λώσνοο), μαλακός-γαμ-β-ρός, γάμος.

Compare the corresponding insertion after vin ἇν-δ-ρόο.

In some words an initial Greek β, mostiy before liquids,
represents a Latins; but β may itsels represent an earlier φ,
as φλὺο seems to be earlier than βλύο 2-

βρέμον, sremo; βλύω,]ἳνο; βάσκανος, fascino.

Α Greek β represents

· (ί.) an original g (p. 53) ;
(ii.) an original μ before ρ and λ-

βλίττον, μέλι ; βροτός, mors; βλώοκον, ἔμολον, βραδύς, mella} (mgdpis) ;
(iii.) an original f in the Aeolic dialect-ag„ βρόδον for

fpdbov before ρ.
Α Latin b represents an original dp in

bellum, duellum3 bis, deco, et„ bimus, dimus; bonus, Old Latin
duonus.

Indo-European bh has become in Greek the hard aspirated
labial φ. Latin, having no aspirateS, represents it initiaily
bys, medially by b:-

φῦναι, suisse; φράσοον, sarcio ; φύλλον, fhlium3 πείθειν (ιφειθειν),
fid03 ῥθφέω, sorbeo ; ἄμφω, ambo; ἀμφί, ambi ; ἀλφός, albus.
