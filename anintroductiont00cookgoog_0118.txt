106 Casas in Greek. [cu.

-οιν, (a) in the other declensions, -οιν, Ep. -οιῖν, The form
δοιῖν beside δυοῖν may be compared with οἴκει, οἶκε, and perhaps
points to an original ι vocalisation of the case. The Greek
endings do not correspond to other Indo-European dual
endings, and cannot be reconciled with them.

The Plural The Nom. Plur. eltds in (Ι) -ες, e. g. πατέρ-ες, add-er, tri-es,
Ques νέκο-ες. The forms βάσεις, ἡδεῖς, os the I· and U-dectensions
are for βασις-ες, Sk. gurnay-as, ἡδεῖ-ις, Sk. saddoc-ur. The
Attic βασιλῆς is the proper contracted form of βασιλῆ-ες, the
nom. plur. of βασιλεύς, while βασιλεῖς is late. (2) In the 0-
aud A·declensions -ες should contract with the stem-vowel
and give lmus (ε lma-es), χωρᾰς (= χωρίς-ες), cf.Slt.apv(1s,
but we do not find these forms in Greek. The nom. plur. of
the O-declension, e. g. ἵπποι, has replaced ῖππως, and has been
formed on the model of rot, Sk. tt, of the pronominal de-
clension. In the same way χῶραι has taken the place ol χωρας.
Accusative. The Accusatt'ue case-endings are (ι) -ns ln the O-declen·
sion -ο-νς, Cretan κόρμονς, passes in Attic into ους, e. g. κόσ-
μους. ln the A·declensions χώρᾶς is for χορο-νς, cf. Cretan
πρειγεντάνς, Att. πρεσβευτάς. In the J· and U-declensions
instead of Boot-us, βασῖς, Sanskrit gaias, and βαρυ-νς, Rapio,
Sanskrit gards, Epic ὄϊς, νέκῡς, we find βάσεις and βαρεῖς,
which are really nominatives used as accusatives, as are
πόλεις, πηχεῖς, βελτίους, etc. (2) '⁹0²⁹’ e. g. πόδ-ας, πατέρ-ας,
φέροντος, etc. From stems in -ῖ we have acc. pl. in -ος,
e. g. Epic πόλι-ος, but in Attic the nom. πόλεις is used. In
Homer we find ὅῖς, ἤνῖς. From stems iu -ιῖ we have ὀφρύ-
us, ue'xu-us, but also νέκῠς, ἅρκῦς, etc. The acc. of βασιλεύς is
βασιληξ-ας, which by metathesis of quantity becomes βοσιλέᾶς.
From monosyllabic stems the Attic aces. νοῦς and βοῦς are
¹newly modelled on ναῦν and βοῦν, and replace vif-as, edf-ar.
Neuter The Neuter Nom. and Acc. suffix is -ο in all stems, but
ξξξιξιιι the older Sanskrit has -ᾶ in the O·declension, elsewhere -z',

e. g. φέροις-ο, Sk. bhdrantu'. ln the I· and U-stems the
