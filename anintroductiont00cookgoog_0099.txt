vn] Accent of Verbs. ⁸7

morae, complete enclisis is impossible, and the secent then goes
as far back as the law ol three morae permits. lt ἡμῖν, for ex-
ample, becomes enclitic, as Znh ἡμῖν is impossible, we get the
nearest approach to it that the laws of accentuation will allow
and write Ζεὺς ἥμῖν. ἤμῖν may then be called a quasi-enclitic.

But just as Ζεὺς ἥμιν is the enclitic formos Ζεὺς ἡμῖν, where
complete enclisis is impossible, so Ζεὺς δοίη is the enclitic
form of Ζεὺς botri (Sanskrit deyrit). Only the distinction
between the enclitic verb in principal and the non-enclitic
(orthotone) verb in dependent clauses, which is observed in
Sanskrit‚ is lost in Greek, and here the verb is uniformly
enclitic, or rather quasi-enclitic.

A strong confirmation of the theory here given is the lact
that the only purely enclitic verbforms in Greek, the present
indicative ot εἰμί and φημί, are the only sorms that nowhere
exceed two syllables and three morae. λέγω might have been
accented like τινῶν, λέγε like τινί, but this was not possible
with λέγομεν, λέγετε, λέγουσι. Here, therefore, we have the
action of analogy: the forms not capable ol enclisis have
necessarily taken the recessive accent as a substitute for
enclisis and have assimilated to themselves the remaining
forms of their system. φημί, εἰμι’, on the other hand, admit
of complete enclisis throughout.

We can however hardly overlook the lact that the accent
on φαμέν, ἐσμέν, and the plural lorms generally, represents
what we shall see later to be the historieally correct accent in
this number, just as ἔστι does that os the singular. Possibly
therefore εἰμι’ and φημί became enclitic not so much from the
number of syllables they contain, as from the purely enclitic
meaning that they generally have. εἰμί is sor the most part
a mere copula, φημί is used like the colloquial English ‘says
I,' ‘says he.' When however they are emphatic, ἔστι takes
the historieally correct accent, and so does φῆμι according to

some grammarians. εἶμί is never accented on the first ι

syllable; il it were, it would be indistinguishable from εἶμι.
