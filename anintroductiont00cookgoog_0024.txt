Slavonic is divided into (1) the southern, including Russian‚
Bulgarian‚ Servian‚ and Croatian, (a) the western, comprising
the Czechish and Polish dialects.

The above are the eight chief divisions into which the
primitive Indo-European language has split. To trace the
process os separation and development is a more difficolt
task. Did our lorefathers come, as has been usually sup-
posed, from the plains in the neighbourhood ol the Hindu-
Kush mountains‚ or was Europe, as some have lately
imagined, the cradle of our racc? In what order did the
different languages break off from the parent stockl Some
writers have constructed genealogical trees showing the order
of the migrations and separatioris of the different Indo-Euro-
pean groups Thus it was supposed that the indian and
lranian were the most ancient, and remained nearest to the
primitive home of the race. The first to split off were the
Slavs and Teutons, and these were followed by the ancestors
of the Greek, Italian, and Celtic nations. But such divisions
are too absolute, lor though the members of these groups ’
are more like one another than they are like other groups,
yet each group has features which connect it with some
member of another group. For instance the Asiatic familias
are distinguished from the European, but yet a special fea-
ture ol the Asiatic languages, namely that they change an
original palata] k into a sibilant sound, is also a feature of
the 'Slavonic languages ol Europe. This shows that lan-
guages cannot be rigidly separated into groups, because
the different groupS, though distinguished in some parts,
overlap in others

Genealogical trees of the different Indo-European races
are to be regarded with a sceptical eye. To begin with, we
do not know how numerous the primitive race was before
the time os separation. As we attribute to it not only the
origin of words and sounds but also the inflexione of a highly
developed speech, the primitive language must have hada
