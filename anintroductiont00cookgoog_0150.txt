originali (u) in the masculine. Thus in Homer we have
Masc. stt-«ts (z fab-for), Fem. ῒδ-υῖα. Maso. ‹ip-rypcis (for
ἀρ-ᾶρωςε ἀρ·ᾰρ·Ῑως), Fem. ἆρ-ᾰρ-υῖα. Masc. τε-θηλ-ώς (= τε·
flat-foc), Ferri. πε-θᾶλ-υῐα. This distinction however did not
remain. Thus in the Homeric u-rlrsvia, πεπληγυῖα, the
strong form os the masc. has intruded. ’

The Perlect has an intrusive a which shews itself
between the stem and the ending. In some persons the
ending was originally added on directly‚ as we see from
ἵδ-μεν, ε’·πέ-πιθ-μεν ln the active and πέ-πυσ-μαι, πε-φυγ-μένος
in the middle. ln Attic Greek the vowel a which appears in
the rst and and pers. sing. was extended to the plural.
Thus ln Homer we have γε’-γον·α, pl. γε’·γα-μεν (= γε-γζι-μεν),
but in attic γέ-γον-π, pl. γε-γόν-α-μπν. ln Sanskrit we find an
i used as the connecting vowel between the stem and the
ending. Sometimes it is difficult to say whether a is part of
the root or a connecting vowel, e. g. ἕσταμεν may be
divided ἕ-στὸ-μεν or ἕ-στ-ᾰ-μεν.

The tendency os later Greek is to make the stem uniform
throughout. Thus stom re'·rox·a we have pl. τε-τόκ-α-μεν.
Rules of sound combination are broken. For instance.
σμ should by rule be simplified to μ, but πε-πυθ-μαι has been
changed to πέπυπ-μαι on the analogy of πέ-πνσ-παι, ἵδ-μπν to ’
ἷσ-μεν on the analogy of ἷσ-τε, and ἦμφίεσ-μαι, revehis-peuce,
ἔζώπ-μεθπ are due to similar analogies. On the other hand
εἷ-μαι and γε-γευ-μένος are regular sor ἑσ-μαι, γεγευσ-μενος

Aspirated The aspirated persects belong almost entirely to later
Pertecrs. Attic Greek. ln Herodotus ἐπεπόμφεε is the only aspirated
perfect act. ; in the Tragedians ἀναπέπροφπς and in Thucydides
πέπομφα are the only instances In succocding writers these

persects are numerous.
Except in late Attic, aspiration is practically confined in
the perfect to guttural and labial stems in the 3rd pl. pers.
