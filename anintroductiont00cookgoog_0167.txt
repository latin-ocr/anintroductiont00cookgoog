The 4th conjugation properly consists of verbs whose stem
ends in ἱ (cf auais- for anal-gs, the stem being seen in auai-
tur, Old Latin autri-bam, autri-bo, and the Greek verbs of the
type μηνέω). But many verbs formed from noun-sterns with
no trace ofi have nevertheless gone over to this system,
eg. saevio (saevus), punio (cf. poena), custodth (cf. custos).
Possibly also all verbs of the rst and and conjugation may
be considered as l'od-verbs, amo, moneo standing for amri-go,
moni-go as τιμάω, φιλέω for rampo, palegu. But as it seems
impossible to get amant, monent from amdgont, mentioni, it is
perhaps better to consider these conjugations as to some
extent at any rate non-thematic. But even in these cases we
find a variation of conjugation—vthlcire standing beside
violens, Ιαυᾱνι beside lavare (Gk. >rofio shews yet another
form), cala're beside kalendae, etc.

The characteristic of the perfect is the reduplicati0n‚ formed The
by the first letter of the stem followed bye (whereas the &Perfert
duplicating vowel of the present is i, cist-0, (ahma-nv).
Further, as we saw in the case of Greek, the singular
of the active originally shewed the vowel t in the case
of those verbs whose present stem contained t, and ὀ in
those whose present stem contained e· (πέποιθα elaeae„ ἔρρωγα
ssfpar), while the plural shewed the reduced root (Hom.
ἐπέπιθμεν).

Reduplication is however comparatively rare in Latin, Redupli-
though it still survives in the case of some twenty‘fivei’aetrlhts
verbs (drir't'ci, cecziu‘, cucurri, etc). The &vowel has generally ⁴
be'en kept in the reduplication, but is assimilated to afollowing
ὅ or ἅ (momordi, cucurrt), and to a following tin the case of
deifici (where the change may be due to an assimilation
to the present dt'sco for drssdc-sco) and also in satri (stilo)
and bili. Of the dgradation there are one or two pos-
sible relics. mimordi, spopondi were in Old Latin memorali,
spaepondi, pointing to presents *merda (cf. σμερδ-νός), *spendo
