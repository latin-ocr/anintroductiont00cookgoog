cases in the person-ending, was lor the sake of emphasis
repeated over again. In some languages not of the Indo-
European family the grd pers. sing. has no personal termina·
tion, and in this case the nominative is related to the verb
in the same lrind of way as the personal pronoun in Indo
European languages. The third person sing. in Indo·
European languages may be represented in its primitive
form bygahe (=}ugoes); in other languages it may be of
the type sother go (=satlrer goes). On this shcwing προσέφη
κορυθαίολος Ἕκτωρ is strictly, Hector, hc rpake,a form of expres·
sion common in our own ballad poetry. It is true that the
personal tennination has disappeared in προσέφη, but it re-
presents an earlier σρσσεφησ, so that at one stage of the
language the subject was repeated twice over.

Inflerional languages have only partly abandoned this
type. In dicit the personal termination is still the subject ol

tion has to a great extent disappeared and we say that the
verb agrees in person with its subject. In modern languages
for the most part it is the last usage which alone survives.

The concord of gender and number similarly originated concord os

and starting with agreement in natural gender was extended with verbs.
to grammatical gender as well, There is not always strict
grammatical concord, lor sometimes the construction follows
the sense of the passage, eg. Capita cory'uratzhnr's virgis caesi
(the heads ol the conspiracy were men, etc), odra? Αἰγίσ-
θου βία. Such constructions are called κατὰ σύνεσιν, according
to sense, by the grammarians, but that is no proof that they
are not earlier than constructions more strictly grammatical.
In the case ol number the concord is not always strict but
the meaning is allowed to influence the construction. Singular
collective nouns sometimes go with a plural verb, eg. be
φάσαν ἡ πληθύς, Pars saxa jactant. Similarly in English the
word prople is habitually combined with a plural veib. In
