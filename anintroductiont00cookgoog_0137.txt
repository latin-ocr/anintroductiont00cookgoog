Forma like βούλει, οἰίι cannot come from βουλισιιι, olenus:
they are perhaps active forms in -ισι transferred to the
middle.
Secondary -oo, e. g. ἔφερε-σο, ἐφεριο, ι’φέρου.
Between two vowels ι should by rule disappear, as it does
in ελὺσω for ἔλυσασο, but in some cases we find it retained, e. g.
πρίασο, δίδοσαι, εἷα, and Epic δύνασαι, μέμνησαι, on the analogy
of stems ending in a consonant, as in γέγραψαι.
