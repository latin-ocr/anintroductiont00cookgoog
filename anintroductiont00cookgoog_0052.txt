40 Vowels in Latin. [c.

similar words were compounded over again, and the vowel of
the second element was kept in circumdatus.
Greekoin Theo of Greek nom. sing. of masc. stems in -ο and
Μ’ “¹ neuters in -οπ answers to Latin ἄ, except where it was pre·
ceded by u: e. g. γένος : genus, corus ε -βύρος, but equos :
ἵππος. And generally we may say that an unaccented ὅ
becomes in Latin ri, as an unaccented ἄ becomes ἱ (fudi,
mab, and an unaccented ἔ becomes ἴ.
A Greek ο in many cases answers to Latin ἅ, especially
before a nasal followed by a guttural‚

ὄγκος, uncus3 ὅν-υ-ξ, unguir; ·cunque‚ qnondam nuncupo for
nomxrlcupo: hdr-c-fijuncms.

Before a guttural in

luxus, λοξός.
Before a labial in

umerus, ὧμοςς umbo, ὀμφαλός ; numus, νόμος,
With long vowels we have
fuir, φὼρ; ulna, ὠλένη.
ιῑπεοοππεπϊ, An original e becomes in Latin i before acombination

of gutturals and nasale-

lag-num, lego ; lig-num, tego; sig-num, ἐπι-κω dig-nus, dec-m
quin-que for penque, πίννη ig-nis, Sk. agni; beni-gum, mali-gnus,
bene, niele.

ln abbe-gnus the e is due to the preceding vowel being i,
as we see from abi-et-is compared with mr'l-it-r's.

There are very few cases of -egn·, ·egm· in Latin, and in
most of them the vowel is long: signis, rignum, tegmen,
obtigmina (cf. tectus) have the apex over the e in inscriptions;
and perhaps segmen may also have the first vowel long.

The Greek vowels are more regular than the Latin in
keeping to the sounds of the original speech. There are
however differences of representation in the various dialects,
especially in the neighbourhood of a liquid or nasal. For
instance, in Herodotus we find πράπουσι for Attic τρέπουσι,
and Attic ''Aprentr is in Doric Ἀρταμις.

The appearance of t in place of original ἕ in ἵππος, Lat.
