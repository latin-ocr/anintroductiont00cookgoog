rw] T he Digamma. 43

But we cannot distinguish between p and f in the same way.
In the following instances a consonantal p or digamma
appears as the second member ofa diphthong.

ἰαχή is for [ι-ῐαχη, from which we have the adjective adla-
χοε for ἀ-ῐιξαχος.

The simple verb ἐρύω is for fepio, from which we have the
compound αὐέρυσαν for ‹i-fcpvoav.

cladem is for ἀπό-[ερση (cf. Lat. ver-rere), the participle of
which tense is ἀπούρας for ἀπο-[ρας.

ἀέξω beside Lat. aeg-eo must stand for ἆ-ξεξω; consequently
αὖξόνω stands for ἇ·Ῐξάνω.

The consonantal p in Latin at the beginning of a word
appears as v, e. g. ver-bum, Gk. feb-opat. Before a consonant ·
it disappearS, as in lora for plora, Gk. ε-ὕληρα. ’

Medially between vowels it is normally kept, as in novem,
Gk. e’v-ve‘fa, oves, Ioves, etc. But even here it often disappears
in verbal inflexion. Ennius wrote firminus for the later
sitinus, and amavisse has a by-form amasse.

After consonants p is sometimes consonantal‚ sometimes a
vowel; and so the poets are able to use sz'lvae and saluae,
soluit and soloti, tenuris and lenpz'a indifferently. In the com-
bination dp, d disappears as in the case of di above, and so
we have suavis for suadpzh Gk. ἡδύς.

The Semivowels r, l, m and n stand exactly on the same Liquids
footing as ξ’ and p. What happens in the one case, happens hussitis.
also in the othen'

As in the strong aorist stem of nefa-o the ε is expelled
and we get ἔ-πιθ-ον, so from πελ-ομαι we get the aorist
ε’·πλ-όμην. ¹

From δέρκ-ομαι and κλέπ-τώ we ought then to get by the
same expulsion of ε the aorists ι’-δρκ-ον and ε’-κλπ-ην (pass).

Now in Sanslrrit we do find a form d-drf-am (which answers
to ε’-δρκ-ον), where rhas the value of avowel, that iS, forms by

itself a syllable. Similarly from the root par we get the
