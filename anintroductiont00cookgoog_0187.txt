1.] The Nominative. 175

any sentence beside which it is used. It is in fact itsella
complete sentence, as ior instance in Ἥφαιστε, σοὶ δι’, etc,
where the particle joins on one sentence to another without
regard to the vocative. It has no proper case-sign but con·
sists oi the pure stem, e. g. ἵπι, πάτερ, etc. The nominative
can always be used in its place, and in the plural it always
is so used and there is no form peculiar to the Vocative

The Nominative (ὀνομαστική) is the case oi the subject olllomina-
the sentence. As in fully inflexional languages like Latin nve.
and Greek the subject is expressed by the person-ending os
the finite verb, e. g. δι’διιινι, it is not necessary for the subject
to be expressed by a separate noun. Rather does the noun
qualify the subject already given by the person-ending of the
verb, e. g. βασιλεὺς dido-or, he, the king gives. In impersonal
verbs the subject given hythe ending is vague and indefinite,
eg. tonat, it (what l) thunders. Sometimes this vague subject
is expressed bya plural, e. g. in Homer, ἶσιι ἔσσεται, tlrt'ngs
wr'll be even. The nominative can serve in the predicate, in
agreement with the subject of the sentence and defining its
meaning, eg. εὗδον παννύχιοι, they slep! all night long, in which
use it is called a secondary predicate. It can serve as pre-
dicate to an impersonal verb in such sentences as σοὶ δὴ
κατηφείη troi duitor ἔσσεται, ’

Here also again we must note the Interjectional Nominative
(p. 165), e. g. δημοβόρος βασιλεύς, silli-devourt'ng king! νήπιος,
fooll etc, where the nominative isa complete exclamatory
sentence, and must be looked on as a predicate witha
subject unexpressed, or expressed in speech by a gesture.

The Accusative is an Adverbz'al case. The Greek namehccusative.
was αἰτιατική, ol which the Latin translation was Accusativm.
The meaning ol the Greek name depends on whether it is
active, i.e. the case oi accusation, which only refers to its use
with a small class of verbs, orthe case of causing, Causatr'uur
