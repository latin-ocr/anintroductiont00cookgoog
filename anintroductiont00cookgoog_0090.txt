tity ol the vowel. Asin the previous cases, the strong root
originally bore the elocent, the weak did not. ’

The Gradations ol vowels in roots are elassified in six
series according to the vowel which is shown in the second,
or, as it is called, Mz'ddle degree. We thus get the six series
of ἰ, o, ὁ, ἕ, ἅ, ὅ. In each series there may be three degrees‚
but they are not always found.

The degrees of the i-series are as follows:-

Dnonnn 1. Dnonna 11. Drcraa 111.
I.-E. ὅ e· ο.
Greek ω η ε or ὅ,
Latin ὃ e‘ d.

eldhe· ἠ’-θη·μι flor-per.
θή-σω tor-per.
ἀνά-θη-μα τί-θε-μω.

Degree 1 os the root appears in the English doom, Anglosaxon ddm.
The third degree os this series appears often as ε ἱιι Greek but in latin as
a. Both ε and a represent the Ι.-Ε. a, and it is possible that in such a
form as θε-τός the quality ol the vowel has been assimilated to the η os
the second degree, e. g. in τί-θη-μι.
