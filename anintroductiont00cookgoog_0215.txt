Χ] Τ he Compound sentence. 203

remains sor us to consider how the simple sentence is de-ment ot
veloped into the compound sentence. {Qec

Apart srom the merely interjectional sentences like ‘Fr're ,θ’

‘ llu‘eves l ' which are mentioned above (p. 164), the simplest
type of a fully developed sentence consists in the connexion
ol a single predicate with a single subject, eg. Cicero est
consul ; or as a more primitive type still, with predication by
mere juxtaposition, ἀγαθὸς όᾶνὴρ. In more complex sen·
tences subject and predicate can consist of different parts

Α further step, still within the domain ol the simple sen· Pasage ot
tence, is taken when the predicate is weakened into a merezlgaffio
attribute of the subject. ln such a case as ‘He begged me on theucnri-
his knecsj it is not easy to say whether ‘on his knees' goes bunne.
more closely with the subject or the predicate. In cases ol
this kind, where we have two predicates attached to one sub-
ject, but one is the main predicate, the other less emphatically
so, we are able to see the process by which what was
originally predicate comes to be merely an attribute ol the
subject.

A second method of amplification ol the simple sentence is Develop-
that by which a combination of subject and predicate is itselfffissm
presented as subject or predicate to a further member ol the pound
sentence. Thus in reddo te beatum, memini me audrie, beatum “ entence.
and audz're were originally predicates of te and me respectively;
but in the development of the language ‘me audr‘re’ and ‘te
beatum' have come to be merely amplifications of the main
verbs reddo, memini. Here we are on the borders of the
compound sentence, and indeed the first instance would pro·
bably be classified as a simple, the second as a compound
sentence. But it is clear that no sharp line ol distinction is
to be drawn between them.

As indicating other lines of development ol the compound
sentence we may notice the use ot nouns in apposition to
sentences and sentences in apposition to noune, e. g. hoc reli·

quomsl, si infitzirs r'bz‘t, testt's mecum est anulus—‘Elim κτάνωμεν
