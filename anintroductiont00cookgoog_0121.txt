v111.] Cases in Latin. 109

menealne—The nonnul suffix is -m ulter vowels‚ -epAeeusa-
(ψη) after consonants. In the majority of I-stems, however, tive.
the termination -em, on the unalogy ol the consonantul stems,
hus become more usual, -e'm osten surviving only in stereo-
typed adverbiul forms (purtem, praesertum, eto).

Neuter nom. und acc. in the case os O-stems take -ea, else·
where consist oi the pure stem modified by the laws of final
combinatione, eg. corhl), lac(t). ' Sometimes they ure assi·
milated to the masculine, us in the adjs. felte, t‘rtgms.

Gentem—The terminatione are (1) -os in the old Latin Genitive.
senatu-os, passing into -us in Cereres. (2) -is, the normal
termination of the third deciension and often also os the
fourth (senatu-is). This termination, though unknown to
Greek, finds its parallel in other I.-E. languuges. (3) -e' in
O· und A-stems (mensa-i: mensae, dommo-i = demerui). (4)

-ᾱε, the original termination in A-stems, surviving in classicul
Latin in famili-as.

Deuite—The termination seems to have been -uy', und in native,

the oldest Latin we find populoe' Romanoe'(for populo-ai). But
in all deciensions a confusion has arisen between the dative,
locutive, instrumentul und ablative endings, and the difficulty
of deciding the origin of any given form is increused by the
fact that at a certain period of the language -ei, -e' or -e' seem
to have been used indifferently to represent the sume sound.
For instance, in I-sterns ove, ulso written evei and oui, was
used in the sense of the dative, but whether in origin it is
dative or locutive is uncertain. Mensae (mensa-i) seems to be
locutive (cf. Romae), but domim may be ablutive (cf.
Corintho).

Lemaire—The termination is -e', which certainly survivesLocative. Ι
in demz'‚}1ume', etc. In some adverbiul forms we get ter-
minations in -ἔ and -ῐ side by side, e. g. peregre und peregri.
The -ἔ strictly belongs to consonantal stems, a final -ῖ be-
coming -ἔ regularly in Lutin (mari, stem mari), the -i to I·
stems by contraction with the final vowel.
