x] Accusalauewith Infinz'taae. 215

The accus. thus comes to be combined with an infin. in a
purely mechanicai way, and so we find the usage extended
to constructions with impersonal and neuter verbs; e. g.

abduou γὰρ πέπρωται ὁμοίην γαῖαν ἐρεῦσαι, laetus sum laudari me
ste.

From this point a further development takes piace. With ⁵

verbs taking a double accus. an infin. may be substituted for
one accus. Dacea te latim laqus¹ does not differ from dacea te
latebas litteras, but it can hardly be said that the first sen·
tence implies the statement loqueris laam, especially as the
first accus. may be omitted. But as the latter construction
gives birth to doceres latzuas litteras, where the verb is in the
passive and the original obJect has become the subject of the
verb, so audio Balbum esse in Syria produces the construc-
tion of the nom. c. int, as audiebatur Balbus esse in Syna.
