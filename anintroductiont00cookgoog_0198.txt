186 Aeliae and Middle. [cn.

object is the direct objectos the aetion of the verb, e. g.
λοὺαμαι, lavor, I waslr mysel, a sense which is rare. (a)
Where the subject is less directly the objectos the verbal
action, e. g. μεταπέμπομαι I send (for some one) to corneto me,
purgor bilem, I get rid of my bile. (3) The intransibile
use, where the reflexive meaning is faint, e. g. ἔρχομαι, l
come, οἴομαι, I think, morior, ldie. (4) The reciprocal use,
e. g. ἀμειβόμενος talnhg ln's turn, which has no representative
in Latin. (5) The passive use, e. g. φιλεῖται, amatur, he is
love.
Distinction No distinction can be made between active and middle on
{flamm the ground that the active forms are transitive, the middle in-
Middle. transitive. Many active verbs are intransitive, and many
middle verbs transitive, e. g. βούλομαι ταῦτα, admiror te. Many
verbs again have some tenses active and others middle in
form without any difference of meaning, e. g. ἁλίακαμαι, ἑάλωκα,
audeo, ausus sum, or the numerous verbs in Greek with an
active present and middle future, e. g. ᾄδω ἔσομαι, φεύγω φεύ-
ξομαι, etc, while in the poets we sometimes find active or
middle forms used indifferently without change of meaning,
e. g. ἰδεῖν, ἰδέσθαι in Homer. In Sanskrit as well as in Greek
and Latin the different tense-stems of the same verb are at
times of different voices, and all this goes to shew that the
line of distinction between the active and middle voices is not
always clearly defined.
The Passz‘ve sense was originally one of the uses of the
· ι middle voice. In Sanskrita special form oi present stem,
consisting of the root and suffix yet, is used in a passive
sense with mune inflexions. Thus from altaasmngcomes
the passive present han-yd-te, Ιιι is smz'tlen. In other tenses,
e. g. aorist and perfect, the ordinary middle forms can be used
in a passive sense.
In Greek the s0·called passive voice consists in great part
oi tenses of the middle. The present, imperfect, perfect, and
sometimes the future middle are used in a passive sense, eg.
