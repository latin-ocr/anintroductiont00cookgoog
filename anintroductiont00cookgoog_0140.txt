128 The Augment. [cn.

before a vowel it is due to the loss of an original consonant,

e.g. ἐάγη for e’·fuyry, εἶδον for ε’-ξιδον, εἵπετο sor ε’-σεπετο, alprat

lor ἐ-σερπονε in the last two σ, though not originally initial,
. has passed into the rough breathing.

In some cases, e. g. ᾤκησα from forato, the initial consonant
has been sorgotten.

We sometimes find η· as the syllabic augment, e.g. in
ἢ-δυνάμην, ἤ-μελλον, ἦ-βουλόμην. This η· may be assumed in
ἐ-ὡρων lor ἦ-ὁρων and ἑ-ἀλων lor ἦ-Ελων, where there has been
metathesis ol quantity as in βασιλέιῑ sor βασιλῆα. In the
perfecta ἑόρακα, ἑάλωκα, which do not have an augment, there
is naturally no trace of η.

The Augment η· may also be assumed in ἦργαζόμην for
ἧῙεργαζομην, and ᾖκαζον for ἧξεικαζον, as compared with the
perfects εἴργασμαι, eleanam.

Where the verb is compounded with a preposition the
augment comes aster the preposition, e. g. ἐν-ἢγον, and some·
times where the preposition is only apparent, e. g. ἐνηντιώμεθα,
formed lrom the noun ἐνάπιος.

In some cases there is double augmentation, e.g. ἠνειχόμην,

κατ-ε-διῄτων, ἠμφεσβήτουν.
