nn] Alphabets. 23

Now that we have classified the different sounds we can alphabeta
pass on to their representation in alphabeto. No alphabet

attempts to represent all the sounds employed in any lan·
guage. Accentuation‚ which is an important element of
speech, is rarely denoted, and the same is the case with
quantity. The alphabeta in use only aim at roughly satisfy-
ing practical needs, and they were not invented in each case
by the nations which employ them, hut were horrowed from
othere. The alphabetic symbols remain comparatively un·
changed, while the sounds they represent are continually
changing, so that it is hard to get an idea ol the sounds osa
language from a study oi its alphabet alone. If we learn a
modern foreign language merely from books, we interpret
the letters ol that language in the light of our own corre·
sponding letters. We give for instance English values to the
vowel symbols α, e, i. We thus see that letters do not tell
us much of the nature of sounds. They have the value
which is associated with them in the minds oi the people
who use them.

So far we have spoken of letters as representing single
sounds. Further difficulties arise when we come to the Ι
spelling of complete worda. In the English language lor
instance spelling often does not represent the differences ol
sound. 1f spelling were scientific it would change with change
of pronunciation ; 'different sounds would not be spelt in the
same way, and similar sounds would not have a different
spelling. The bearing ol all this upon the study oi the Prouincia-
classical languages of Greek and Latin is clear. They are no {1³2de
longer spoken, so that wc cannot hear the living sounds„ We languages.
only have the alphabeta and the literary spelling, which, as we
have seen, are imperfect instrumenta But the transcription
ol Greek words into Latin and conversely of Latin words
into Greek helps us in determining the actual sound of a
word, and ancient grammarians also give an account ol
