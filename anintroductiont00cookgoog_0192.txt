tive genitive, e. g. οἶμοτός εἷς ἀγαθοῖο, magni anrirrr' esse, where
the genitive serves as the predicate of the sentence. This is
plainly a development of its use with nouns.

tucaland The genitive is used in Greek in a local and temporal

temporat. sense, expressing not like the acc. the extentos an action,
but the limits within which it takes place. Thus θέειν πεδίοιο

’ means “to run within the limits ol the plain‚” while πλεῖν
θάλοοσον is “ to sail over the sea.'’ The genitive in the local
sense is not certainly original. The temporal genitive on
the other hand seems to have been original, and occurs both
in Greek and Sanskrit, e. g. θέρους, χειμῶνος, νυκτός. In
Latin the ablative is used, e. g. quadriduo quo baec gesta runt
(Cic). From this use possibly came the genitive absolute in

meaning ol the ablative proper. What formal traces there
are of an ablative case in Greek have been given, p. 104. We
find the ablatival genitive in Greek with verbs of leaving
freet'ng, hz'rzdmhg, and the like, eg. ἔσχοντο μάχης, βάθρον
ἴστοοθε, and also with such adjectives as κενός empty (fi γυμνός
bare <fi In some cases it is not easy to say whether the case
has the meaning oi the ablative or the true genitive. With
verbs ol hearz‘rzg, for instance, the genitive may express the
source from which we hear, or the person in or os whom we
hear something. Again the genitive expressing the material
ol which a thing is made, with such verbs as τεύχω, πονῶ,
