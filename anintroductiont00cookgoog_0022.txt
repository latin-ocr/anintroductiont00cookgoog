where Ionic has η, by the avoidanoe of the oxytone aecem,
in which it resembles Latin, and by the use of the mnooth
breathing, e. g. in ἶπος. The other Aeolic dialects are
known chiefly from inscriptions. That of Northern Thes·
aaly goes along with Lesbian and Boeotiam while Arcadian
and Cyprian may be classed together. With the exception
of lyric poetry‚ the chief forms of literature found expression
in the Ionic and Attic dialects, and Attic heom the leading

dialect of ancient Greece. Under the lilaeedonian'Empire l

it lost its purity and gradually passed into the ωσὴ &altem

of Polybius and Plutarch. The vulgar speech formed the ¹

basis of the Hellenistic Greek of the LXX and the New
Testament Out of the κοινῆ have been developed the
modern Romaic dialects.

4. The Albanian is classed apart from the Greek family;
of its earlier history we have no recorda, so that it is
difficolt to speak with certainty of its‘ relation to other
groups.

5. The languages of the Italic family divide themselves
into two main gronps-the Latin and the UmbroOscan.

The earliest remains of Latin date from about three
hundred years before the Christian era One characteristic

of this language is that there is no evidence of a sub
division into dialects till the time when it became the

speech of the different provinces of the Roman Empire.
The literary language naturally became more or less stereo-
typed at an early period, and still more entirely so in the
epoch which begins with Lucilius and concludes with the
augustan Age. The vulgar Latin, on the other hand, was
the speech ol the common people, and it was this form of
¹the language which passed into the Lingua Romana of the
Empire and gave birth to the eight Romance languages of
Southern Europe, Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan (in North
Spain and Roussillon), Provencal, Italian, French‚ Rhaeto·
