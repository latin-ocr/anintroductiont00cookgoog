self into the past and dramatically represents the pastas
present; in the use of the present as future the coming event
is represented as already happening‚ e. g. ἄπάλλυμαι, pereo, I
shall pert'sh. Sometimes the present is used in the sense ol
the perfect, e. g. ἥκω, I am come, οἴχομαι, I am gone, or with an
adverbial addition, κεῖνον igneio πάλαι, medudum loquor.

As there are many ways of forming the present stem, it
becomes a question whether all these different formatioris
originally bad the same meaning. Thus in Sanskrit from
dbis, bear, we have the presents bhartr', bharatr', bz'bharti,
which seems a needless luxuriance. It may be that originally
different present stems denoted different kinds of action, and
that one present stem meant to be going continuously, while
another meant to go of a single act, as in the I go, Sir, but
went not of the Gospels. Although as a matter of lact in the
case of some present stems, eg. ἡβάσκω, putresco, I grow
young, there is a special meaning connected with the form of

the stem, yet in the case of others we find no differenee of
meaning.

Imperfect. From the present stem is formed the imperfect, which
represents an action as going on in past time. In Sanskrit

it is the tense of narration‚ but in Greek its place as a tense
of narration is often taken by the aorist.

As with the present, so with the aorist there are different
tense-stems Thus in the active we have the root-aorists
and the sigmatic aoristS‚ but there is no general difference of ¹
meaning to be discerned, even supposing that originally the
different formatioris had a different meaning.

The aorist denotes the simple occurrence of an event in ¹
the past without specifying how near or how distant it is in κ
reference to the time of speaking, e. g. ὀ Κῦρος ἐτελεύτησεν. In Ὗ
Latin the aorist and perfect have combined in a single tense.

In Greek the aorist has become the tense of the narration of ¹
past events, a province which in Sanskrit belongs to the im·
