90 Accent in Latiae

when the penultimate fs long, when it falls on that. Itis
plain that this is only a stringent application of the law of the
three morae, which would seem at first sight to be of universal
application in Latin. Nevertheless there are not wanting
indications that the historic or free accent once obtained in
Latin. The weakening of vowels in composition and redu·
plication, which is unknown to Greek, can only point to the
accent having once rested on the reduplication or the prelix.
Confinir, can only come from consecto, tetigimus from tlta·
gz'mus3 and that this is the original accent in composition
can be seen from Sk cipi asta} Gk. ἔπεστι. Again the sup-
pression of vowels by syncope often points to an accent
further than three syllables from the end. serpat implies
sfrrzpui, Somnzitm Sabinum, optimus apetamus, etc.

Enclisis is of very common occurrence in Latin. -ηε, -υι,

-que, are enclitics‚ and arc said by the grammarians to throw
their accent back on the final syllable of the preceding word

(rosaque). cs and cst are also frequently enclitic, and si·
idmst corresponds to καλόν ἐστι. We have primitive enclitic
pronouns and particles (often with corresponding forms in
Greek) ln si quis (εἴ τις), nlquc (οὔτε), lli-c, iub-ple, νηί-Μ,
nl-dum, etc. Possibly the prepositions are enclitic in quo·
cum, param-per, etc. And finally we may mention certain
cases in which a whole phrase has only one accent, and the
unaccented members of it may therefore be said to be enclitic,
e. g. profecto (profacto), illico (fn loco), dumo (dl novo), zgitur
(the enclitic form of agz'tur), first appearing in the Plautine
phrase quid egitur? (quid agitur Β)
