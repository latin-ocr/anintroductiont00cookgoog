Enclisis. ·

The law of the three syllables or more strictly of the
three morae, is therefore practically ol universal applicatiou
in Greek. lf we now turn to Sanskrit, we find a very different
system in operation. The accent is not confined within the
narrow limits which restrict it in Greek and indeed >in Latin,
but is ‘frea' that ie, it may sall upon any syllable in a word ;
and its actual position is determined not by the quantity of
the final syllable (as in Greek), nor by that os the penultimate
syllable (as in Latin), but solely by the inflexion of the word
and its fonction in the sentence. No more striking instance
ol the differenee of the two systems can be given than hythe
case of the finite verb, which in Sanskrit is unaccented,
except when it appears in dependent clauses or at the
beginning of a sentence.

Now from a variety ol considerations, but chiefly from
Verner's law, it is certain that Sanskrit represents tolerably
faithfully the accentuation os the original Indo-European
language. How then does it come about that the system
which we find prevailing in Greek is so totally different l*

It is obvious that there are some words in Greek which
exhibit the original ‘free’ accent. The accent of πέντε, ὀκτώ,
πούς, ποδός is the same as that of the corresponding Sanskrit
words patrica, artri, pdt, podas. But the accent of ἐβούλευον,
ἐβουλεύετε represents a new principle, which has nothing cor-
responding to it in Sanskrit and conforrns to the law of the
three morae.

There are some words in Greek which under certain cir-
cumstances take no accent of their own, but ‘throw it back,’
as the expression is, upon the preceding word. But the
accent in enclisis‚ like the ordinary aecem, is limited by the
law of the three moram that is to say, the enclitic word is
considered as part os the preceding word, and the whole
combination is then accented in accordance with the law of
three syllables. Ζεύς μοι is accented like κήπου, καλός ἐστι like
ἄζωστος. But where the enclitic word contains more than three
