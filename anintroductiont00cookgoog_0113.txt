vuu] S-Stems. σοι

these stems as s-stems is that in Greek the masc. shews t and
not s. Ι

In Latin there is no certain relic oi this class.

4. The comparative stems with suffix aas, -tee- have an
intrusive nasal inserted both in Greek and Sanskrit. Thus
from gariuds (heavier) we have acc. gariya‘nsam, gen.
gariyasar, cf. Greek μείζων, μείζονα, μείζονος. In Greek, how·
ever, we find the stem without the nasal in the ‘acc μείςωε
preytae-u, gen. misenam-uomet, ete. The nasal is always
preserved in the nom. and dat. sing. and in the gen. plural.
The suffix -μς- appears in the Epic πλέες (πλε-μσ-ες). The
reduced sorm ol the suffix, i.e. -is-, appears in the super-
lative suffix -ισ-τσ. In this form there is no trace ol
anasal.

In Latin the nasal seems never to have existed, and the
termination os the comparative is ·y'os(·1hr) with the long
vowel of the nominative carried throughout the inflexion.
Some traces ol the forms -ges- and -2's· remain in majestas
(mah-pu, cf. πλέες), pr-is-cus (cf. pr-thr), mag-rs, nam-a, etc.

Originally there was a variation os the root vowel in
Greek between comparative stems in -ῳσ- and superlative

stems in -ιστο-, eg.

κρείττων, Ion. κρέσσων κράτιστος.
daciscam ὀλίγιστος.

But neither in Sanskrit nor Greek is there any trace of a
shifting of the accent accompanying the variation of the root
vowel.

In most cases the vowel of the root has been made the
same both in comparative and superlative, and instead oi
βαθ-ὐς, *flend-anu, βάθ-ιστο-ς we have βαθ- as the root in all
degrees ln some cases we find a difference of quantity in
the comparative which may be referred to an original stem
variation‚ eg.

lanx-dc ἐλάσσων (= lhayxyorv t'or kam-yon) ὲλάχ-ιστο-ς.
vax-ria odaeum (εθαγχέωνὶοτθεγχ-έων) cdx-coros.

phau μᾶλλον (= magoviorpeh-yov),1at. meliusudhum.
