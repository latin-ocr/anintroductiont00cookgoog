111.] The Vowels. 19

rather noise resulting when the breath is closely squeezed or
stopped at some part of the mouth or breath passage. This
passage has two outlets; one at the lips, the other at the
nose. In the case of some consonants the passage is closed
at a given point, e. g. at the lips inp, l; at the teeth in t, d;
at the palate in k, g, while the nose passage is closed by the
bottom of the soft palate. In the case of other consonants
the passage is not closed but only narrowed, and the breath
sounds against the narrow walls, as in s, s, ch, &c The nose
channel is left open in pronouncing n, m.

In the case of vowels the breath is not checlred or closely
narrowed at a given point, but passes freely through the
mouth passage. 'With each different vowel-sound the mouth
passage assumes, it is true, a different form which modifies
the sound, but there is no check or hindrance to the free
issue of the sound, nor audible friction after the breath has
been vocalised by the vibration of the vocal chorda.

I. Vowels as wellas consonantscan be classified according clacifica-⁴
to the place of their articulation in the mouth passage. Of 3333}
course there is not with vowels as with consonants a com- ’
plete or approximate stoppage at any point, hut the places
of articulation can be distinguished by the position of the
tongue. Each new position of the tongue is accompanied
by a fresh vowel sound. The tongue can he moved horizon-
tally backwards and forwerda, or vertically up and down.
Thus in pronouncing a the tongue is moved baclrwards, in
pronouncing iit is moved forwards horizontally„ Again in
pronouncing the e of pretty the tongue is moved up nearer the
roof of the mouth, in pronouncing the a of monitis moved
down vertically. All vowel sounds canbe classified according
to thcsc horizontal or vertical movements of the tongues

IL Every vowel sound can further he distinguished as open
(also called Wt'de) and Slut (also called Narrow). In the
shut or narrow vowels there is more convexity of the tongue,
,and a sense of effortl and strain in- pronunciation
