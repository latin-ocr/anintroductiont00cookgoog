X] Tha Futura. ¹93

As the imperfect isan augmented present tense, so the Plupertecr.
pluperfect is an augmented perfect In Greek the tense is
used more frequently than in Sanskrit and either has an
intensive meaning or, as in Latin, denotes an action fulfilled

in the past, corresponding to the two meanings of the perfect
stem.

The future denotes that an action, whether continuous or Future.
momentary, will take place in time to come. It is a question
whether the time of the future refers to the subject expressed
in the person-ending orto the speaker. ln the case of the
first person there is of course no doubt, for both speaker and
subjectare the same. But in the case of πράξει, was the
original meaning Ire wall act at a time future to the stand-
point of the speaker, or it is noto his intention lo act? Upon
the answer to this question depends the relation in which the
future is to stand to the subjunctive mood. According to
one view the oldest use of the future is its use to denote the
purpose of the subject, a meaning which is best seen in the use
of the future participle, eg. ἐπέδραμε τεύχεα συλήσων. In course
of time the sense of purpose, expectation or fear, called forth
by contemplated action, was transferred from the subject to
the speaker, and the future carne to express what the speaker
thinks is likely to happen. Another view derives the sense of
purpose which is found in the uses of the future from the
temporal sense it has in denoting consequence, while the
sense of purpose will belong more properly to the subjunc-
tive mood. The future then, as having other than temporal
meanings and involving the mental attitude of the subject or
speaker, is almosta mood rather than a tense and must be
considered in close connexion with the subjunctive mood.
We may note that Sanskrit has a future subjunctive though
Greek has none.
