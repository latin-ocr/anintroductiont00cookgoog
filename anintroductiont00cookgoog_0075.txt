ln some cases an aspirate appears simply on the analogy of
cognate or related forms. Thus the Doric ἁμές, Attic ἡμιῑι,
owes its rough breathing to ὑμεῖς, and ἧσται, Sk. risle, to the
analogy ol ἕξομαι as sed.

The alternation ol rough and smooth breathings in the blitmf·
same or cognate words may in part be explained by the law {¹023 and
by which not more than one aspirate is allowed in the same smooth
word. The root of ἔχω is ειμι, which would regularly pro· breathrng.
duce ἔχω, but the first aspirate is dropped because of the
following χ. ln the future however the second aspirate is
lost and the first re-appears in ἔξω. Similarly one termination
os the imperative is -θι (ἴσθι), but λύθη-θι is altered into
λύθητι. This may explain why from the root red we have
ἕξομαι, ἕδος, ἵζω (or-odo), as well as ἔδαφος, ἔδεθλον.

An original σ between two vowels‚ as we have seen, dis·
appears, but only by first becoming the rough breathing, so
that the change is the same as we have seen taking place
with initial σ. Therefore an original spidos will become in
Greek fifides, genitive Hidros: the nominative may have
given rise to lopas, the genitive to ἴδοι.

Similarly the original prefix raon- becomes ἀ- when there is
an aspirate in the following syllables, as in ἀδελφός, ἄλοχοι,
but ἁ· when there is no following aspirata, as in ἅιιοι, ἅπαξ.

Forms like ἀγάλματος, ὄπιδος, ἁθρόοι are due to confusion.

ln some cases however the variation can be referred tono
such general law, but must be ascribed to a differenee of
dialect, as in the Homeric οὖλοι, οὖροι, ἦμαρ, ἅμαξο beside
the Attic ὅλοι, ὅρος, ἡμέρα, ἅμαξα, where aspiration may be due
to erasis with the article.

Attic ἥλιος, Epic ἠέλιος, cf. ἁντ-ήλιοςς Attic ἵππος, Lat. equus, cf.
Aeria-caron Attic ἔοις, Epic ἠώς, are also instances of variation.

H in Latin is the regular representative of an Indo· Hin Latin.
European gh, gh, and perhaps bh, dh at the beginning of a
word.
