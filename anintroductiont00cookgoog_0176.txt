together. Thus in Man is morial the term mon is the
subject, is the copula, and the term morial the predicate. It
is from the logical analysis oi the sentence that grammarians
obtained the terms Subject and Predicate. In Greek and
Latin the copula and predicate are usually combined in a single
word, e. g. ὁ ἵππος τρέχει, the horse is running. Consequently
there is no need to distinguish the copula from the predicate,
and the first analysis oi the >tt-yos or proposition recognised
merely the ὄνομα or subject, and the ῥῆμα or predicate. Now
though it may be possible to analyse all sentences which
express acomplete meaning into these parts, it is evident
that we employ in every-day speech sentences which do not
conform to the pattern ofa simple affirmation or nega-
tion. 'Besides the simple statement, we utter Wilies, Prqyers,
and Questtbns, all of which are expressed in sentences ol
different form, and none of which are recognised in Logic.
Again, when we say Ft're l Really! Nonsensel we convey
a meaning perfectly clear to those who bear us, but not
expressed in the lorm of the logical proposition. For the
purposes of Logic such sentences must be expressed in
logical form3 for Logic, being concerned with language only
as the instrument ol thought, attempts to reduce the varieties
of speech and thought to the lewest possible forms and treats
all sentences as enuntiatory3 while Grammar‚ on the other
hand, is concerned with the study of language and all its
different forms of expression, as they are, lor their own sake.
Il we study the grammar ol a particular language, we seelr to
classily the idioms of that language in reference either to the
whole ol its history, or to its usages at a particular time. ln
the study of the Comparative Grammar ol different languages
we take the forms oi expression employed in those languages,
and seelr to discover the common clement which underlies
their variatione.

Incomptete sentences admit, as a mle, of grammatical analysis into
sentences. the Subject-that of which we speak or think, and the Predi-
