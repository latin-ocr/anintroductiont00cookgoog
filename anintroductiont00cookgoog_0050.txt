38 . indetermrirate Vowel.

Saurkrit. Greek. Latin.
vam-i-td ἔμε-τός vom-ltus
jan-i-trir γεν-ε-τήρ gen-i-tor.

The instances shew thatin Greek the indeterminate vowel
is represented by either ιι, ε oro, and it is not easy to lay
down the laws under which it appears, now in one form, now
in another. In Latin we may say that roughly speaking the

indeterminate vowel becomes u before l and ηιμ before r,
i before n ; while elsewhere in an accented syllable it is
represented by a, iu an unaccented by i. Most frequently it
is inserted between the final mute of a stem and the initial
liquid of the termination to facilitate pronunciation‚ though
in many cases there are bye-forms without the inserted vowel

which are to be considered the older.
Thus with the Indo-European suffir ·lo- we have

saec-u-lum beside saec-lum—vinc-u·lum beside vinc-Ium-pupuius
beside Pupi-isola, old Latin poploe—Heremias beside mc-hercl-e.

In early Latin the inserted vowel iu this class of words is
more frequent than in classical Latin. Plautus, e. g. uses
discip-uiam, nomene-uiator for the later disciplina, nomen-
claior.

rigam, we can compare

um·c-rur with Gk. ὦμος (darom-inferus with infra—volup,
vol-upa with Gk. fian-oper, f-fohru—col-u-mna, col-umen with cul-
men-sumus with Sk. sniis, Gk. f-opfv.

The insertion of such a vowel is also common in the
earlier transliterations of Greek words, e. g. drac-u-ma
(δραχ-μή), Tec-u-messa (Τέκμησσα), Aesc-u·lap²'us (Ἀσκ-ληπιός),
m-i-rm μνᾶ). Later however a more accurate method of
representation prevailed, except where the result would
have been a combination of letters quite foreign to Latin, as
e. g. μνᾶ.

Balancing A special feature of Latin is the tendency of unaccented
powerofl. vowels separated by l to be assimilated to one another.
Thus in calamitas the first a is mdical, but in the compound
