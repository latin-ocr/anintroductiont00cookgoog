¹74 The Casas. [cn.

Lasdy, by the laws ol Latin phonetics a final -ἅ and a
final -ἴ both necessarily become -ἷ, and accordingly the in·
strumental and the locative in consonantal stems of the 3rd
declension are indistinguishable.

A coalition of the cases in some sort therefore is partly
inherited from the primitive language and partly inevitable
owing to the phonetic laws ol the individua] language3 and a
coalition beginning in the plural would extend to the singular
and vr'ce versa. Every language, however, and to some ,
extent every declension has gone its own way in this matter.
The dat. ahl. plur. is lost in Greek but preserved in Latin
The instrumental plural is lost in Latin except in the 0- and
A·declensionS, in which however for the most part the dat.
abl. is not found.

in certain contexts their meaning is so similar that it is in·
different which is employed. Thus it isos small importance
whether we speak ol carrying a box ori the shoulder
or wr'th the shoulder, but one ol the two phrases would
eventually predominate over the other, and so it comesto 3
pass thatin Greek the dative, which in the consonantal decl.
is formally a locative, and in Latin the ablativo which is
everywhere, after the loss ol the final -d‚ indistinguishable
from the instrumental‚ are exclusively used to convey this
meaning. ,
Case lorms which have become detached from their de·
clensiorrs, such ss χαμαί, and shew no other cases from the
same stem, are called Adverbs. Prcposr'tz'om are words which
have been called into existence to supply deficiencies in the
cases and help them to express relations which they either
cannot or do not clearly express. We can now take the
cases separately.

at all. It stands by itself apart from the construction of
