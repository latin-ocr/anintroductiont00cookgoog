Throughout the different classiiications the distinction of Noun and

Noun and Verb as answen'ng in the main to the distinction νεὼ·
between Subject and Predicate is the most important. The
other parts of speech express relations subordinate to the
main distinction between Subject and Predicate. But the
number of words is great, and the number of relations to
be expressed are many and complicated. No division ol the
parts of speech can hope to be absolute. Had the gram-
marians come first in order ol time, words might have been
parcelled out in neat and definite divisions. But the gram-
marians came late into the field, alter men had been using
language to express their different needs according to their -
different capacities for countiess generations. When lan-
guage was at length reduced to writing‚ it could become
fired and independent ol those who spolie it. Its usages
could be analysed and classibed, and become models sor
succeeding writers. The study oi grammar apart from logie
began in Europe at Alexandria, where scholars studied the
earlier literature oi Greece chiefly ior the sake of settling the
text oi Homer, and laterior the purposes ol constructing a
practical grammar to assist in the teaching of the Greek lan-
guage at Rome. Plato had distinguished the ὄνομα and ῥῆμα.
The Stoics recognised ἄρθρα (articuli), and provided an asylum
for other words in the σανδέισης or adverb. Aristotle had
noted inflexion or πτῶσις, which included the inflexions of
the Verb as well as the Noun, and even degrees ol com·
parison. The Stoics confined πτῶσις to Nominal deciension,
and distinguished the Nominan'oe (ὀρθὴ, εὐθεῖα), Accusativc
(αἰτιατική), Gent'lt've (γενική), and Dalt've (iorni) cases, as well
as Tenses and Moods in the Verb. The Alexandrian gram-
marians distinguished eight parts of speech—impu (nomen),
ῥῆμα Ι(ιιιτόιιιιι), σύνδεσμοι (comminues), ἄρθρα (articuli),
