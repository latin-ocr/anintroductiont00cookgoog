Br'm' stands lor dpoy'noyJ (Engl. twarir) as br's for dryr's, and
from this form the suffix ·r'ni has been extended in the
distributives to lrziu', quini.

Nonus lor nopmur may owe its second n to assimilation.
The later ordinals are formed with the suffix -timus, -rtmur
-thus‚ vigesimus: origii-trinus ; and then -c(n)simur was
taken as the suffix throughout the series.

Ter beside τρίς may represent an unaccented lorm, perhaps
originating in some phrase like bz‘s e! ter pronounced with
one aceent. The same theory will account for terties beside
τρίτος where the Sk. lrtiya shews the root syllable to have
been originally unaceented (p. 76). Quoler(instead of *quoturl
would seem to owe its final vowel to ter. The rest present
no special difficulty. The adverbs in -rens seem to be
originally substantival; oltricus, τριάς (ἱνιξῳ).
