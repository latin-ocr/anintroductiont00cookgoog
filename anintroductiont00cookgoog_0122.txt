Ablative.

Ablaliuer-The termination is ·d, but the final vowel of the
stem is lengthened before the consonant, so that probably
the termination also contained avowel. The consonant is
lost in classical Latin, but in early Latin we find forms like
Gnozbo'd (Gnaei), and the forms med, ted are common in
Plautus, both as ablatives and by a further extension as accu-
satives. An ending with adverbial meaning is -tus‚ e. g. fundi-
tus, penitus, ziz-lus, Gk. ἐν-τός. Another ending with ablatival
meaning comes in ziz-de, un-de.

ledramniet—The terminationis -ἅ, which must become
in later Latin -J, and therefore coalesces widi the locative.
Any certain trare of it is therefore hard to find. mana, e. g.,
may be (ι) instr. for manu-e, (a) abl. lor menri-d. Possibly
the adv. qui stands for quie (from qui-s) as fise forfihe.

The Dual survives in ambri, due, perhaps ectri, and possibly
in the neuters of the fourth deelension which denote a pair of
things—genet, corne (p. 105).

sonantal stems, as in pede's, or the lengthening may be due to
the analogy of the accusative. There is no certain trace of
this ending in A-stems in Latin. (a) In 0- and A-stems
the terminatione were originally ·oi, -ai as in Greek, and may
be explained as borrowed from the pronominal deelension
(riti, ritae). mensal becomes mensae as in the gen. sing. The
forms of the O-declension were successively poploe, puple,
poplet', populi.

Accusattbe.-The termination is -us after a vowel, be·
coming -s with a lengthening of the preceding vowel (equo's
= equi-nr), and -grs after a consonant (pede's :pedgrh ln
I-stems the proper form is ouis (ruins), but the analogy
of the consonantal stems has produced the by-form
oves.
