In comparison with Latin we find

Ι.-Ε. t Greek. Latin.
gksd- - nr-sus(-orc-sus).
kgd-r' -l cordi-s (gem).
pgsb- · porrum(=por·sum)‚
spgtd· spor-tola.

Il. At the end of a word we lind the Liquid Sonant in
I.-E. g'ekg't· ἧπαρ jecur.
ΙΙΙ. Before i there takes place in Greek Epenthesis with g, Before ρ.

as for instance ἀσπζρω becomes ἀσπαίρωε with l there is
assimilation‚ as for instance ‹regie› becomes σκαλλω, and ligio,
βάλλω.

IV. Sometimes the liquids rand lbecome sonant even be- Before

fore a vowel, botin such cases they are followed by the con· mel&

sonants r and l, when we may write them 0rr, gl. We may
illustrate this from the other semi-vowels ξ and gr where the
same rule holds good. If to the stem bhru-inSlr.bhr12-s‚ ⁰
Gk. ὀ-φρύ-ε, we add the genitive terrnination Sk. -os, Gk. -ος, we
shall get a hiatus, which being inadmissible (p. 65) is bridged
over by the doubling of the u·sound and we obtain lirun-as,
l-optif-os. Similarly from the root στελ- in στεἊλω the strong

aor. pass. is ἐστάλην, where αλ- represented the doubling ol

the liquid sound to gl, though the Greek methodos 'repre-
senting gl is not different from that of representing!

Again
Bagis represents I.-E. wel-s.
τάλ-ας represents I.·E. 4!th-
