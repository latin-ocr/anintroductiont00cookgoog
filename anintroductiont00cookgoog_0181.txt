of sex is obvious, gender fluctuates in different languages.
English, for instance, is strict in confining gender to sexual
differences‚ except in the case of poetic personifieations, e. g.
She wolks the woters lohe a thing cy‘lffe, of a ship. But in
Greek, for instance, καρδία is fem, in Latin coris neuter, and
we need only refer to modern French and German as
notorious instances of fluctuatione of gender in the case of
names of things which shew no distinction of sex. Such
genders may be called grammatical. Now, apart from
natural gender we find agreement in grammatical gender
between Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. For instance, omre,-
ὦμος, humerus are masc, vok, ὂψ, vox are fem.,yughm, ζυγόν
and jugum are neut, among many other instances of agree·
ment. These similarities point to an inheritance of gram-
matical gender from the original language. However, as
the correspondence of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit genders
is not complete, we have to ask how differences could
arise. In most instances the gender ofa noun is deter-
mined by its stem-suffia. Now in the Adeclension, though
the stem-suffix is a mark of the feminine, we also find
in Greek and Latin masculines of this declension. Such
masculines were, it seems, originally feminine, but their
meaning has changed, and with their meaning their gender.
For instance, uenulae (a youth) might have been originallya
feminine νιανια used in the sense of a company ‘V youths in
general. Constructed in this sense with a plural verb, it
might get a plural termination and become νεάνιαι. lf νεάνιαι
meant youth collectively, νεανια in the singular might naturally
come to mean an individual youth, and after it had thus
become masc in meaning, it also became masc. in form, and
instead of νεανια there arose νεανίας with the case-ending of
the Odeclension. In the O-declension‚ which is almost en-
tirely masculine and neuter, some feminines are found, such
as νῆσος, ὁδός, etc. These are masc. in form, and were in all
likelihood originally so in gender. In some instances we
