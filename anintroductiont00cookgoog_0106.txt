94 Inflexion osA- and O·stems. [cu.

This wealr inflexion is found in the dual and plural of all
nouus, whatever the stem.

A· and 0- (3) Nouus of the A· and 0- declension (ist and and)

stems.

belong to neither strong nor wealr inflexion. With them the
accent does not change and the vowel before the termination
is not lost; but we have an altemation in the final vowel of
the stem between o and e, ᾶ and ἅ, which to some extent
corresponds to the vowel change in the Strong Inflexion.

We can now see how these systems of inflexion apply to
the different declensions.

Stems in 0. Stems in' O are characterised by a change of o to e in the

vocative both in Greek and Latin.

ἵππο- Voc. ἵππε.
domino· „ dominc.

As arule O-stems are masculine or neuter.

Stemsin A. Stenas in A show a variation of the suffix vowel between

ᾶ and ἄ corresponding to that between 0 and e in O-stems ;
e. g. the vocatives νῦμφό, δέσποτό answer'to the vocatives οἶκε,
llys. Nouus of this declension are mainly feminine, but
some of them on the analogy of the O-declension have
become masculine and takes as the termination of the nom.
singular, eg. νεανία-ς, Old Latin parr‘cz'da-s. In Homer we
find masculines of this declension without s, as eg. νεφελη- Α
γέρετα, ἱππότα, which may originally have been vocatives.
The Latin nominatives in -ᾶ must come from an original -ᾱ,
as an original -ἄ unaceented would in Latin pass to -ἔ,

Greek feminines in -ια, e. g. rorata, answer to Sanslrrit
femininos in -ῐ, e. g. pdln-i. The corresponding Latin
declension is the fifth in -ie'.
