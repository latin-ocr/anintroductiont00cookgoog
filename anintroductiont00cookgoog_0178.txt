taber. Other words express qualities or attributes belongingto
a subject, and are called Adjectiver, e. g. λευκός. Others denote
relations of qualities or actions, and are called Adverbs, e. g.
ποῦ, neri. Others again express states and actions, and are
called Verbs.

Substantives and adjectives are, as we shall see(p.168),
not always to be distinguished

2. According to their sunction words can be distinguished

¹¹· into those which oi themselves can form a sentence, those

which can serve as members of a sentence, and those which
serve to connect members os a sentence. Among words
which of themselves can constitute a sentence we may rank
Interjections and the forms os the Fz'nr'te Verb, e. g. τρέχει,
clamat, where the stem expresses the predicate and the ending
the subject. This is, however, a property only of inflexional
languages. Among words which can serve as members of a
sentence we have the Substantive, which serves as subject,
and the Verb, which serves as predicate. Other words
besides Substantives can serve as subject, e. g. in such a
sentence as Slow and slcady wr'ns the racc. Other words
besides the verb, such as substantives and adjectives, can
serve in the predicate. In Greek the adjective by itself can
serve as predicate, e. g. ό ἵππος λευκός (tlre horreis white), t
where the article distinguishes the subject, and no copula is t
required. In Latin, owing to the absence ol an article, only ³
past participles are, as a rule, used in this way, e. g. fusi ,
hoster, except in some proverbial expressions such as omnm
praeclara rara.
