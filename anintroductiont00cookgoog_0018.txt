6 Analogy. [cn.

which he forms instinctively on the analogy of other words.
When Demosthenes said φιλιττ-ἰζειὴ Πυθία, everypne under-
stood him, just as the meaning of such terms as ‘Glad-
stonian' and ‘ Opportuniste' is clear in modern England and
France. ⁸

By Analogy too new forms contrary to established usage
' are introduced, but unless the new form is accepted by a
majority of the speaking society, it will never be used to the
exclusion of the old. Sometimes it happens that the new
form which is due to Analogy exists side by side with the ι
form which is the result of Phonetic Law, e. g. Σωκράτην side
by side with Σωκράτη. Where there is a similarity of mean-
ing between one word and another or a group of words, the
tendency is by analogy to make them resemble one another¹
in form. Thus by phonetic law εῐ-μί takes the place of ε’σ·μι,
side by side with εἀ-τί, but instead of εῖ-μέι like εῖ-μί we find
εἀ-μίν on the analogy of ιά-τί and ιά-τέ. Analogy then
leads men to systematise the different forms of words and
arrange them in symmetrical groups. A few instanees from
different languages will illustrate this.

The regular Epic form of the third plural of κεῖμαι is κέαται,
as the law is that ι between vowels should disappear3 but
upon the analogy of κεῖμαι we find in Homer κείαται as well
as κέαται elsewhere κεῖνται

The participle βεβαώς resembles ἑαταιέε, and soon the
analogy of ἕστακα (ἕστηκα) arose the perfect βέβακα (βέβακα).

In the same way γεγαώι resembles ἐσταώε, audon the
same analogy we find in Pindar the perfect γεγάκειν.

“ Again from the stem of βασιλήια is formed the verb
flandri-o. On the analogy of this verb we have δουλεύει, but
the noun from which this is derived is δαῦλα-ε not δουλευ-ε.
ln French we find αιἀιοειε (emimus), armes (amitis)
altered from *amons, *amca on the analogy of αιἀιε (imo).

in Anglo-Saxon we find fcit, pl. flt, answering to modern =

English frvot, sect, but for As. bic, pl. bic, modern English
