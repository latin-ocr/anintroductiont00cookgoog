(for ulmus) contrasts with the Gk. ἵ-μεν, and Sk. elmo‘s. ’
Like eo are queo, nequeo, which do not appear in Greek.

2. Root do, dri, where the weak root has been generalised
(dri-re, dorem, ete), except in dri-s and originally clo-t. For
da-tus as compared with Gk. δο-τός, Sk. deltos, see p. 80. Do
by the side of δίδωμι seems to have lost the reduplication‚
unless we are to take it to be an ‘aorist-present’ parallel to
the Greek *(ἔ)δων, plur. -έδομεν, The old pres. subj. duim
seems similarly to correspond to the Greek aorist do-frrv.

3. Root es, s.
The original inflexion of the present would have been

tls-rgo ἕω tls-t s-mds s-tl s-gtt.
Sk. ‹is-mi dvi usti smds sthd sdnti.

eos became es, the quantity it still bears in Plautus, though
it was subsequently shortened as an enclitic. sum, as we have

seen, perhaps corresponds to the Ionic imperf. ἔον (ἕσαν), and
the loss of the e is due to its use asan <melitio-compare the
corresponding loss in the enclitic 3rd person (duruerat, eto).
From sum were then formed sumus and sunt. The strong
form of the root is extended to the and plur. on the analogy
of the singular.
ero is either a subjunctive form, corresponding to the
Greek ὦ, ἔω (ἔσω), or else represents the nonenclitic form
esim, of which the enclitic is sum. The original long vowel
of the 1st person of the thematic system seems supported by
the long vowel of Sk. bhdromz' (biterrim). , Eram has not yet
been satisfactorily explained.
The pres. subj. is really optative in origin, and takes
therefore the suffix -ίῖ- in the singular, -z'- in the plural.
edi-m, s-ii-s, s-ie-t, s·2'-mus, s-i·tt's, s-i·nt.
Gk. liuhap-v, ἔ(σ)-ιη-ς“, ἒ(σ)-ιη, ὲ(σ)-ι-μεν, Kal-twa
Sk. syri-m, s-yo‘o, syri-t, syri-ma, syri-ta.
The original form of the singular is common in Plautus,
but in later Latin the analogy of the plural has prevailed.
