124 T he Moods. [Ch

indepen- tude (legatiinterea) ol the speaker, and these differenccs

dent Μ’ are expressed by differences of formation. All inquiry into
the meaning of the moods must start with independent sen-
tences. How old some forms of subordinate sentence are,
we cannot say; but the simple independent sentence must be
the oldest, and from the combinations ol simple sentences
have arisen the complex constructions ol later syntax. Ii we
find in Homer the combination μή τι ῥίζῃ in the sense oi J
fem lu will do something, we must not explain the use oi μή
by saying that δείδω is omitted, sor this is to explain an
earlier idiom by a later usage, and to turn a simple sentence
into a complex one. It is not to be supposed that there
is one meaning for the moods in independent, and another
in dependent sentences. Each mood had its own proper ’
sense, but in course of time there grew up different uses of
the moods as they were employed in the expression ol new
shades of meaning. The indicative, for instance, is the mood
ol simple assertion, but in Greek we find it used in con-
ditional sentences, in final sentences and in wishes.

In Greek we shall take our instances mainly from Homer,
for it is there that we find the sreestuse ol the subjunctive and
optative in independent sentences a use which in later Greek
became more restricted. In Latin there is unfortunately
nothing which corresponds to the syntax ol Homer. Our
knowledge oi the earlier stages of the language is very small,
nor are we able to follow its later development without inter·
ruption. The interval between Terence and Cicero, which we
know must have been important in the history ol the language,
is hardly represented at all in the surviving literature.
