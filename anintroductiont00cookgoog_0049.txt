As consonants p· (y) and p (w) are treated p. 42-

The combination υι stands apart from the diphthongs
proper as both components are semivowels. As a double
sound they appear in συΐ, δρυΐ, as a single sound in the
Homerlc νέκυι, πληθυῖ. Other instances are μυῖα, πεπληγυῖα, etc.
Before a consonant υι was not allowed, as we see from the

Homeric optatives ἕκδῦ-μεν, dervi-ro (εέκδυι-μεν, harma-ro).

Α vowel is sometimes developed, both in Greek and Latin, The Inde-
between two consonants. But this vowel differs from the pppiepare
vowels proper a, e, oin the fact that it has no definite char·
aeter ol its own. In the Indo-European alphabet we have
given this indeterminate sound the symbol a In Sanskrit
it appears as i. As instances of the indeterminate vowel

we give the following :—

I.·E. Sk. Greek. Latin.
tlstha (stand) stlr-a-tds sth-i-tds ordros stit-tus.
alda dalbs d-d-i-ta δ-υ-πός dia-tus.
asse· s-a-tos ἔ-τός sa-tns.

p-atlr pai-teir rdervip p-it-ter.

This same neutral vowel appears inserted between the
root and the termination, but it is difficult to be certain

whether it is to be looked upon as part ol the root or not

Sanskrit. Greek. Latin.

dam-i-td ' ‹idda-daos dom-itus.
