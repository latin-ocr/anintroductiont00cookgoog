Xd Τ ha Deliae. 183

receive from some one, θέμεσπι δέεπο δέπας means to receive
as a favour at the bandi ff Under this head may come the
dative oi the agent which is used with verbal adjectives, and
with passive participles, eg. τὰ σοὶ πεπραγμένα, J'ormz'datus
Othom', where the act is looked on as a possession or advantage
belonging to the person in the dative. In Latin this dative is
usually found with verbals and past participles only, e. g. nobit
fiectendo, things for us to do, nobt's facta, things we have gol
done. Under the Datiaus Commodi come the Ethic Dative,
e. g. τί ε’ροὶ καὶ σοί 3 and the Dative of Relation‚ e. g. oppidum
primum venz'enlt'bus ab Epiro, συνελόντι εἰπεῖν, etc.

(a) The dative in a locatival sense denotes the place of an π.. Loca-
action, and is commoner in Homer than in later Greek. In ffive.
Sanskrit there is a special locative case, while in Latin place
where is with few exceptions expressed by the ablative.
Instances in Greek are αἰθέρι ναίων of place, and ἀριπρεπέα
Τρώεσσιν of persons.

The dative is found after verbs os motion, eg. πεδίῳ πέσε,
it clamor caelo, where it answers the question Quo? and

shews that quo is not a meaning confined to the accusative

. alone.

(3) The instrumental use oi the dative, like the Latin 3. Instru-
ablative, expresses the accompaniments or the means oi anssffi
action. Thus in the sense oi the accompaniments oi an
action, whether persons or things, we have the dative used with
ἕπομαι, ὁμιλέω, and such nouus as κοινός, ἀκόλουθος. ΤΟ this sense
“ belongs the idiomatic use of the dative with αὐτός, e. g. adroic
ἀνδράσιν (men and all), the addition os the pronoun marking
that the dative is to be taken in this sense. Ol datives
which express the attendant circumstances os an action we
may instance βίᾳ, σιγῇ, χρόνῳ. Sometimes it is used in away
which resembles the use oi an adverbial accusative, e. g.
εὕδειν-ὕπνῳ, φόβῳ δείσας.

From the sense of accompaniment the instrumental dative
passes to the sense of means, in such instances as δουρὶ
