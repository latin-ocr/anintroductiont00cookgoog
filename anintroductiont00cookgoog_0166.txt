(5) Inceptive class.

The suffix -sco, -sce is added in these verbs generally to
the reduced root.

(a) Immediately to the simple root—pa-sco, cre-sco, hisco,
mi-sceo (mig-seeo), posco (sor. porc-sco, pgc-sco, cf. prono, precor).
Add gno-sco, gna-scor, which however present great difficulties
in their cognate forms. Probably there was a primitive con-
fusion of the two stems. Ignarus must come from gnosco
butowes its ἅ to gunnor, while the Homeric γνωτός, ‘a blood
relation‚' must come from the same root as gneum, but
owes its ω ῖοιγιγνὼσκω. The relation of gnascor to gigno,
γίγνομαι, and of the Greek κυσί-γητος, γνήσιος, where the ry,
being found even in Doric, must be primitive, to gnatus is
very obscure.

(b) To derived stems of various kinds-gem22sco, treme-sco,
-sctlsca arde-sco, laba-sco, dile-sco, quii-sco, puero-sco.

(ὁ) The Voti-class form the present ste'm by adding -ιὀ-,
-t'e· to the root, which is generally reduced. Thus—

Farc-t'o (cf. φράσσω sor &pax-w), salio (ἅλλομαι sor aalma),
tircrb (ι’άπντειν asiam), venri> (gg-io), etc.

But the forms adamat, ete, in Plautus are not contractions
from adventat, but are aorists·presents formed without a
Vod suffix.

In the inflexion of verbs of this class we find a confusion
between tenses formed from the pure stem and those formed
from the stem increased by -io, -i'e·. The stem can, e. g.
appears in captus, cap-ere, cap-il, but capilo is al'od-form.
In pdltivr some forms come from the aorist stem pdt- (prit-i-tur),
others from a stem pod— (poti-ri, poti-tus), and similarly the
stem pet· in pito stands side by side with the stem pefe- in
penui. So also we find a combination of different stems in
the conjugation of mortar, orior, cupzaflrdri, etc.

To the Voti-class also belong all verbs of the 4th conjuga-
tion‚ and those of the third of the type statvo (for statii-th).
