vnn] Stems in land U. 95

Formative suffixes coming under the general head of the
0- and A·declension are :—

-qye, -μᾰῃ in lar-for (feror, inor), epuns. rohfry (πολλή).

—mo·‚ -md- in οἶ-μος, ἀκμή, Lat. firmus, an—i—mus, etc.

-n0·, ·nti- in θρό-νος, ποινή, τίκ-νον, Latin som-nus, donum, etc.

-monci, -meno, ·mno·, ·mna· in θέψενος, χαμμονὴ, σςροςμνῆ, ter·
minus, colu-mna, legi-mini. etc.

-lo·, -la- , ·ro·‚ -ra· in σφοόψό-ς, ἐσθλός, etc. And others beside

Stems in I and U belong to the Wealr inflexion‚ but we Stems inl
must distinguish two systems of declension. and U.

(r) Where the final vowel is 13²2 before a consonant and
fh up before a vowel. Thus in Sanskrit we find nom. όΙιῐ-ς,
acc. bhiy-ana and nom. blei-s, acc. blein-am. Hiatus was
not allowed, and in Sanslrrit, as in the original langrrage‚i
and 12 before a vowel develop the corresponding semivowel.
In Greek we find κῐ-ς, tri-dr (zen-or) and cippi-r, ὄφρῧ-ος
(ε ὀφρυΙῖ-ος).

(a) Where the final vowel is i, u before a consonant but
ey, ep before a vowel. Thus βόσῖ-ς answers to Sk. goti-s, and
nom. plur. βάσεις (βασες-ες) to Slr. geitay-as3 ἡδύ-ς answers to
Sk. όόλᾶᾶά-ό, and ἡδεῖς (= hdef-er) to Svdddv-as.

The declension of πόλις varies. ln Homer it is declined
like κῖς, viz. addi-r (cf. wolf-mr), gen. aditi-or (επολις-ος), but
in Attio adli-s, πόλεως (zauber-or) like βάσις. Α stem nonq-
appears in Epic πόληῖ, πόληος, πόληας.

I-stems in Latin often lose all trace of their final vowel
except in the gen. plural (e. g. pars, paralum, cf. the neuters
in -al‚ -ar, which are shewn to have been originally I-stems
by the plurals calcari-a, eto). We often find moreover a
second suffix added, as in the case of the whole of the
leonine abstract substantives in tzion„ which correspond to
Greek forms in -σι-, -τι-. On the other hand some stems
originally consonantal have become I-stems in Latin, e. g.
the femininos in -rrn'- corresponding to Greek nouns in -της-.
An ι’ has intruded itself universally in Latin before the
