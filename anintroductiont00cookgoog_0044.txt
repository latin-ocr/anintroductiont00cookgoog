32 Indo-European A. [ch.

These have been more faithfully preserved in Greek than in
the related languages.

The Latin language, as we find it in classical times, is ἵ
almost entirely devoid of diphthongs proper. The only one ξ
which survives is au, and even here we find a strong ten· ’

dency to substitute a simple sound for the diphthong. In
the time of Cicero, for instance, some branches of the

Claudian gens called themselves Clodii, while others still y
retained the more archaic spelling' of the name.

IndoEuro- IndoEuropean ἄ = Greek u and Latin ἅτ
pean d' e g. dvo, ‹lb3 ort, ωιτη ἀγκών, ancus3 ἀγρός, agen ἄνεμος, animm.
In all the foregoing instances in Latin, the short ἄ comes
in the originally accented syllable; in the unaccented syllable
it always appears as ἓ at the end ofa word, in close syllables
(i. e. before two consonans), and before r. Thus we have
zade beside ἔνθα. So forms like mollitiem are parallel to
Greek forms like ἀλήθειαν with short a. As ἄ remains in
Latin in nom. sing. fem. and neut. plural, it must originally
have been long.

Other instances of ἕ in Latin for original ἄ are pdrh'ceps
(cap-zo), rlddere (dare), plu-e (instrumenta13 cf. ἅμα, πέδη).

In open syllables, i. e. syllables ending in a single con·
sonant, before labials and l it becomes ii, which changes,
except before labials, to l, as fn-sultb, tiz-silzb (salzb), occupo
(cap-tir). Before l followed by a consonant it becomes u,
which does not change to tfimulto).

In other open syllables and before ng it becomes ἵ, eg.
contingit (lango), adigo (ago), etc.

Indo-Euro· Long Indo-European ἁ appears in Greek as ἃ, but in Attic
penna. and Ionic mostly as η; in Latin as ᾶ.

In the above instances we have written ᾶ in the Greek
