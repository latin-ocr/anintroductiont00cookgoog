rx.] The Optative. 143

The Latin as well as the Sanskrit nom, noma, have the
wealr ass throughout.

With weak root we have the optatives βα-ιή-ν, θε-ἰη, ἁλώῃ-ν,
‹iva-tior (for duno), and in the plural φιτ-ἳ-μεν, dvi-pra, tot-po.
The wealr root should appear in the optative of τίθη-,ιι and
δίδω-μι. Corresponding to Sk. dadi-yda dodydm we have
rade-ipo, ὃιδο-ίη-ν, just as in the indicative τίθε-μεν, bido-per
have taken the place of τιθ-μεν, διδ-μεν (ρ. 130).

(2) Where the indicative has the thematic vowel, the
optative suffix is ψ, egoe'po-m, Sk.bh‹1rcs. In the rst sing.
we have the primary ending -μι, eg. φέροι-μι. In Sanslrrit
the ending is ·am (gv), answering to which we should expect
‹pepo-pa (gv) in Greek, which however would become φέρω,
and so be identical with the indicative and conjunctive. In
the 3rd pl. the ending is -εν, eg. φέρο-ι-εν, as in the non-
thematio ε-ἶ-εν. We should expect the ending to be -αν for
original -gtt which we find in the Elean cuv-iau: waso-gaufr),
I.-E. s-i-git. Εἶεν stands apparently for εῑῃντ, with the suffix
of the singular and η shortened by rule before the semivowel
followed bya consonant (p. 66).

The aorist optatives in -αιμι, e. g. δείξαιμι, δείξαις, are
new formatioris upon the analogy of the thematic -οιμι, sors.
The more regular Attic and and 3rd pers. are -ειας,
'mlvi‘

The true sigmatic aorist optative is seen in εῖδείηνεεῑδεσ-ιη·ν,
εἶδεῑμενεεῐδεσ·ι-μεν. The so·called Aeolic optative in -σεια
was probably extended from the ending of the 3rd pl. of the
sigmatlc aorist optative, e. g. δείξειαν (dux-octav).

The contracted verbs in Attic have the suffixes -ιη- and -ι-
with the thematlc vowel, e. g. τιμῴην (= ripa-own), τιμῷμεν
(wira-owni). The Attic φιλοίην (εφιλε-ο-ιη-ν) differs from
the Aeolic φιλείην, where there is no thematio vowel. These
optatives have followed the analogy of verbs in -μι, The
plural φιλοῐμεν resembled the plurals διδοῖμιν, δοῖμεν, and so
the singular φιλοίην was made to resemble δοίην, διδοίην.
