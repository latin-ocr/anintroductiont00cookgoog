of the same root, theolumz's, which was originally accented
on the first syllable (p. 86), the second a passes into u before
the m, and the first is assimilated to it and becomes o. Simi-
larly an unaccented a before a labial becomes u (cripte,

’ aoupo), but yet we find alapa, not *alapa The law may be
largely illustrated from the substantives and adjectives in -lz's
as compared with those in -lua ln the first case the vowel
of the penultimate syllable is u, in the second ι’. ln Greek
for example we have adjectives of the type εὐτράπελος,
εἴκελος, etc.; but in Latin we get only on the one side srinr‘lir
(cf. ὁμαλός), humilis (χθαμαλός), on the other bibulus, pendulus,
tremulus.

Hitherto we have seen that in ordinary cases Greek Unaccented
a, ε, ο, ι, υ correspond to the same vowels in Latin. ln some vowels.
cases however special laws intervene to prevent the corres-
pondence being complete, as when a Greek ου becomes in -
Latin auor ελ becomes ol. ln unaccented syllables in Latin
the vowels tended to lose their proper sound and approximate
to that ol the indeterminate vowel, andare then at the mercy
of the surrounding consonants‚ and are treated in the same
way 'as an indeterminate vowel inherited from the original
language. It is noticeable that in Greek vowels are not in.
any way affected by the presence or absence of the accent.

Exceptions to the regular representation of vowels in un-
accented syllables are due to various causes. In some cases
the archaic pronunciation and spelling is preserved, asin
quaesumus, volumus, where u represents the Greek 0, which
ordinarily becomes in Latin i. Sumus, if an enclitic, ought
to become simus, and this ¹is actually the way it was spelt by
Augustus But u tends to be maintained in such cases in
initial syllables-cf. labet beside aber. Another important
cause· is ‘re-composition! The past participle of circumdo
ought to be circumditur like redditus, but alter the law that
weakened unaccented vowels had ceased to operate, this and
