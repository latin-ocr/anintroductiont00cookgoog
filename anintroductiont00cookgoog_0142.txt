130 Reduplicated Stems. [Cb

ἵ-σ-θι we have the wealr stem σ-, but the original s-dhi, pro-
nounced adli, has had an ι prefixed in Greek. Other
instances of stem-variation are vsdd, φη-μί, dupin dota,
‘wll-v, aar-nn„ ἵκευ, grw εἰκὼ), xri-wm- The
tense ἔχω should originally have run ε’-χεῑ-ᾳι, ε’-χευ-ς, ε’-χευ-τ,
plur. t-ynpw, etc„ but ἐχεα· has been taken as the stem and
extended throughout in ἔχω, ἔχεας, ete.

(b) No stem-variation is to be found in &yvo-v ἔ-γνω-μεν,
ἔ·φῦ-ν &pri-peu, or in the stems os (ir-02, χρῆ-σθαι, ἔ-δρᾶ-ν,

’ ulfy-ro, and othere.

2. The Re· (a) The Reduplicated Non-thematie Present·stems have ι

gfflsoe‘ed as the vowel of reduplication. Stem variation is shewn in
ἵ-στη-μι, bord-pen τί-θη-μι, ride-pem δι’·δω-μι, dido-per. An-
swering to the Sanskrit forms dadh-mds, dud-mus, we might
expect in Greek τιθ-μεν, διδ-μεν, but we find a connecting
vowel os the same quality as the vowel os the singular between
stem and ending. The 3rd plurs. τιθέ-ᾱσι, hit-ena, Ion.
τιθεῖσι, διδοῦσι, have been already explained (p. 124). Stem-
variation is also to be found in πίμ-πλη-μι, πίμ-πλᾶ-μεν. In San·
skrit we have ῥίψαν-νηί, which would be represented in Greelr
by πι-πελ-μι. The πλη· of πίμπλημι is due to the analogy of
the aor. ε’-πλὴ-μῃν. Νο variation appears in κί-χη-μι, δίζημαι
and others.

3· Stems (3) The thirdclass of Present·stems consists of the wealr
with ⁵²ffi¹ root and suffixes nep, nu. In Sanslrrit we have scr-nomi,
-uu, sonu-mets, but in Greek the variation is vo, vt, e. g. δείκ-νῡ-μι,
δείκ·νῦ·μεν, instead of δεικ-νευ-μι, delevi-ptr. The suffix luyp-
appears only in the thematic verbs, eg. κινέω (abacyro),
beside κί-νῠ-ται, with weak suffix. In the third plural υ re-
mains with hiatus before the ending, e. g. lysiam (τραγ-νυξ-
aare), cf. sk. fak-nuwanlz‘. Had υ become consonantal we
should have had fayvf-amdyurm. The third class os
