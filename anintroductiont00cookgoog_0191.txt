classed as original. Ol genitives with noune we find in
Greek, Latin and Sanskrit the genitive expressing: (ι) son eps,
e. g. Σωκράτης δ Σωφρονίσκου. In Latin this usage is only found
with foreign names. 'We may however compare Flaccus
Claudi (F. the slave of Claudius); (alpossesszbn, eg. ἡ oleta τοῦ
ποτράοε (3) the material os which a thing consistS, e. g. οἶμοι
κυάνοιο, but it is doubtful is this is a Sanskrit use; (4) a parti-
tive sense, eg. aliquid temporali, δῖα θεάων, (5) subject or
object, δ φόβος τῶν πολεμίων, the sear which the enemy feel, or
the fear felt ol the enemy ; (6) besides these are the genitives
with adverbs of place and time, ποι) γῆς nli gentiam? τρὶς
τῆς dulgas, etc.

The genitive is also used with verbs both in Greek and
Sanskrit and to some extent in Latin. This use ol the
genitive must be compared with that of the accusative. The
genitive is less completely than the external accusative the
objectos the verbal action, and hence its use with verbs has
been described as Quaszzparn'tne, lor the action ol the verb
is qualified. Amongst the verbs which are constructed with a
genitive which answers to an accusative of the external object
are Verbs: (1)0f slarrng and gr'vz'ng, eg. ἐδίδου τῶν ἑαυτοῦ,
(a) of eatrng, drinking, lastang, eto, eg. λωτοῖο φαγών, (3) ol
hearang, percn'rring, knowzng, etc, e. g. εἰδότα χάρμης, and verbs
of remembering andfhrgettr'ng ; (4) of rnlr'ng, eg. τῆς θαλάσσης
ἐκράτησεν, regnauit populorum (5) of ararath, conplar'nt, and
condemnaltbn, etc„ Κύκλωπος κεχόλωται, κρίνομαι θάνατον, capitis
damnare, as well as verbs ol dszlzng, arinzng al, etc. ln
Sanskrit, verbs of taking delzghl z'n, konig, etc, are constructed
with agenitive. All the above sets of verbs'may be regarded
as having constructions inherited from the original language, Ι
though each use is not equally common in Sanskrit, Greek
and Latin, Greek being freest in its use of the genitive with
verbs.

A use ol the genitive which may be reckoned as primitive, lffredica-
though more common in Latin than Greek, is the predicanve'
