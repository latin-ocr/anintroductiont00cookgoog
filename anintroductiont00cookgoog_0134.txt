Second
sing. act.

122 Person Endings. [cn.

always -nnl In the Perlect the ending is a, which seems to
be original

(2) Secondary‚ -ν for I.-E. -nr, e. g. ἔφιρο-ν, Sk. &dhara-m.

Alter consonants -ν becomes sonant and appears as -α,
e. g. ἦα lor lya-gn. 'This -ιι has by analogy replaced -ον in the
forms ein-n and ἤνεγκά.

It has been supposed that the secondary endings ol thematic verbs,
I.·E. om, -ιι, -et, Gk. -ον, -ις, -e, and Sk. -αηι, -ar‚ -αι, are earlier in origin
than the primasy. In Sanskrit the primary endings seem formed by adding
-ι’ to the secondary, e. g. -a'nri (with long vowel), ·asi, «eti answering to the
Greek non-thematic endings -μι, -σι, -τι, In the Greek thematic endings
o, -ιις, -ει, it has been suggested¹ that ι hns been infixed or passed into
the preceding syllable. Thus φέροι = φιροα -- orpora = φιροιιρι, where
mbas become sonant ; φέρεις is loroepe-re and φέρει lor φερε-ι-τ. This
theory does not account sor Lat. sord (p. 148).

Second Person Szhgulor.

(ι) Primary‚ -σι, in Sanskrit bhdra-sr'. In Greek this end-
ing only appears in the Substantive verb, viz. Homeric ἐσ-σί

ln Thematic verbs the ending ol the present is -εις, e. g.
φέρεις.

The ending ol the and sing. pers. act. was -θα which
answers to Sk. -tlza, and survives in ola-da for cleda, Sk.
odi-tha, and ἦσ-θα, which points back to an old perfectio,
Sk. risa, ἦσθα, etc.

In the Homeric ἐθεἊῃ-σθα, dehoc-adn, etc, -σθα has replaced
-θα on the analogy of olo-da, ἦσ-θιι, in which the σ belongs
to the stem (cf. p. 126).

(2) The secondary ending is ·ι, eg. ἔφερε-ι, φέροι-ς,
ἵστη-ς, ἔλυσα-ς.

Third Person Sz'ngular.

Third pers. (1) Primary ending -τι, in ἐσ-τί, Sanskrit ‹is-ti, Doric δίδω-

srng. act.

τι, Attic dido-or, Sanskrit dddd-li.
This is the ending in Greek of the third sing. of the -μι
