sponds, not to a European a or o, but to a European ι. For
instance, we bave from the same root arh-as with k before a,
but arc-is with c before 2'3 Sanskrit hataras with h before a
ansvers to the Greek rhemos, but from the same root we
have Sanskrit ca ansvering to the Greek τε. This shews
that though the Sanslrrit alphabet only contains one vowel·
character, a, yet this a must once have had under certain
circumstances the palatal sound of the vowel e, before which
the true gutturals h, g, gh became the palatalised gutturals
c, j, h. We shall give fuller instances of this change
later on.

It is very difficolt to give a clear account of the matter, owing
to the unfortunate ambiguity of the technical terma employed. The
change of Sanskrr't k, g, gh to c, j, h before i, y and an a representing
an original e is due to the fact that i, y, e are palatal sonnds, whereas a
is a guttural vowel, and before them accordingly the gutturals k, g, gh
becorrm the palatals c, j, h. Bnt both k, g, gh and c, j, h represent
the velars of the original Indo-European alphabet, while the palatala of
that alphabet are represented by y, j, h. Of these f is a sibilant sound,
hut is recognised by the grammarians as representing an original gut-
tural. jand h, the solt and aspirated sonnda in this series, have no sign
to distinguish them from the corresponding sonnds in the series c, j, h;
but again the grammarians recognise the fact that j and h have not
always the same origin. Again, h is the letter which represents an
older jh or aspirated j. It will be seen that the term ‘palatal' has
a totally different meaning when used of the Sanslrn't alphabet to
that which it has when used of the IndoEuropean alphabet. We
have not however ventured to introduce any change in the accepted
terminology.

Sanskrit therefore does not really support the supposition
that the original alphabet only contained one vowel, a.
Rather we must suppose that it once contained an ewhich
has ceased to be distinguished from a in sound, and the
same character is used to represent both. But if it contained
› c, there is no difficulty in supposing that it also contained o,
for o is a sound which alternates with e regularly in roots and
terminations-e. g. we have γεν- alternating with γον· in γένος
beside γέ-γον-α. Here again we must suppose that what
