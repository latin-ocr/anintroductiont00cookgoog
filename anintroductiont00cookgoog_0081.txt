va] Short Vowels in Latin. 69

An original el becomes ol (ul) except before land i.

volo, vellm, vellem. eolo (lor quelo): inquilinus.
volvo: fendo.

But an initial cel, gel remain, (celer, gelu).

pe becomes po.
vomo, feudo.

But pe was by a later change reestablished‚ at any rate
in close syllables, and we get uestis (feo-(3615), uesta, nobum:
ci. uicus (aereus), vinum (ueritum), beside form, folrat, etc.

The ordinary rules governing the treatment os unaecented Unaocent-
vowels, and of vowels in composition must be looked for in ed vowels,

the grammars. But uve may call attention to one or two
points.

Latin possessed certain intermediate sounds not exactly
represented by any letter, and consequently sometimes in-

dicated by one character, sometimes by another. maxrmus
beside maxumus represents the modihed a sound‚ lor which

Claudius invented a special character; vitulus beside vetus
perhaps a similar sound intermediate between e and i.

A similar theory seems required to account for the alterna-
tion of ὁ and a, ei. ἱ and z'which we have noted above (p. 34).

The doubling of short i and of short u was avoided:
abactis contrasts with banalas, mortuos (post-Augustan
mortuus) with dommus.

Lastly, it is probable that? and &preceding the original
accent became ἅ-, cf. rods and ἐ-ρετ-μός, oar (for vadis) and
ἅ-[εθ-λον, magnus and μέγας, saluas and soledus.

eng, onc, ong become respectively ing, unc, ung. trago
rippa-uncus tyros-unguis ὄνυξ (I-E. onghl). Also before gn
e becomes τ’ in agnis sor gagnei, Sk. ogni, dagnus vsdec.

An original ri and probably also ro and ru in an un-
aecented syllable become er. Thus certus beside κριτάς,
cervus beside κριός, acerbus for *acribus sacerdos sor sacro-dor,
terreo for trosly'o, a causative of τρέ(σ)ω. Hence also nomina·
tives of the and declension like ager sor agros.
