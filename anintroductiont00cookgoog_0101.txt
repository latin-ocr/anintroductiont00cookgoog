The ‘anastrophe’ of prepositions seems simplya case oi decentor

the survival oi the original accent. The Sanskritdp136pa,{}22¹}⁰⁵¹
apa indicate that ἔπι, ὕπο, ἄπο were originally paroxytone.
This accent they naturally keep when used adverbially or
added as an emphatic aiterthought to bring out the meaning
of a case. Coming before their case they are procliticS, and
are strictly speaking not accented. As a matter of fact they
are written with a grave accent on the last syllable, but

euclides-cf. τινός, τινί, ποθέν, ποτέ, etc.

The Latin system of accentuation stands in strong con· decentia

trast to the Greek. It is true that the law oi three syllables ¹³5⁰·
is common to both languages; neither in Latin nor in Greek

does the main accent recede lurther than the third syllable
irom the end of the word, but in all other respects the two
systems are totally distinct. Their main differences are

two r·-

(i) In Latin the quantity of the penultimate syllable
determines the accent, that oi the final syllable being oi
no importance: in Greek the quantity of the final syllable
determines the accent, that of the penult being of no im-
portance.

(ii) Oxytonesis is unknown in Latin, except where a
paroxylone word has lost its final syllable, as audin ior
audisne. ¹

The law oi Latin accentuation is simply this-that the
main accent falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, except
