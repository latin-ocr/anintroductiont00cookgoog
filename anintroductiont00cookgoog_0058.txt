46 Nasal Sonants. [cn.

Long V. The Liquid Sonant sometimes appears as long, in which
sonants. case I.-E. ff, l become in Greek ρω, λω, and in Latin νᾶ, ld, as in
I.·E. alst? owed-s stra-tus
5ng liparo-s gra-nu-m.
The Nasal So much then sor the Liquids as Vowels. To prove that
Sonants. the Nasals m and n could be used as vowels is more difficult.
We do not find in Sanskrit rapas we find ‚r, l. But letus
compare the following:

Sanskrit. Greek. Latin.
ta-td τα-τός ten-tus.
ga-td βα-τός ⁸ven-tus

⁸ na-ma ‹lvo-pa nomen.
sapt-d ama sept-em.

Evidently that which happened in the case ol the Liquids
has also happened here, only that in Sanskrit and Greek the
nasal has disappeared, leaving no trace ol itself whatever, and
being represented solely by a vowel-sound. Thus τατός, tata,
must go back to an original tpto, where gv represents the
nasal sonant. In Latin, on the other hand, the sound of
nasal sonant is represented by a vowel and consonant.

The Nasal Sonants p, gn are represented in Greek by a, αν,
up, andin Latin by en, cm. There is no symbol in Sanskn't
for the use of the Nasals as vowels.

1. We lind the Nasal Sonants in syllables which were un-
accented in the original Indo-European language‚ before

, mutes, nasals, or at the end of a word, when they appear
simply as rga, ga, in Greek as a, and in Latin asem, en.
