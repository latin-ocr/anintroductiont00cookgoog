Z, earlier 1, takes the place of Phoenician Zayin.

The letter Ξ, Phoenician Somekla has in Greek a new
name, εἰ. Before the archonship of Euclides this sound was
in Attic represented by xa (clu). The Ionic Ξ does not
appear in Italy, where the sound was represented byx (cs,
chr). In the Ionic alphabet Χ (i. e. χῖ, cb) represents the

hard guttural aspirate, though it holds the same position as κ

the Roman X (chr).

The Greek σίγμα takes the place of Phoenician Shz‘n. Ac· ³

cording to Herodotus (r. 139) the Dorians called σόν what

the Ionians called σίγμα. This may point to a difference of ,
sound and σάν may represent the Phoenician sibilant Trade⁸ ¹

The compound σαμπῖ is used to denote 900.

The non-Phoenician letters introduced into the Attic from
the Ionian alphabet in the archonship of Euclides, were Φ, Χ,
u, and Ω. The sounds of the Greek aspirates Φ, θ, Χ were
not, in all probability, fricative like the sounds of modern
English s and th5 they were momentary sounds followed in
each instance by a distinct breathing. Thus X represents an
English t’h. Before the introduction of the symbols ψ
and Χ, the sounds were represented by the double letters
nu, rur.

The Roman alphabet was borrowed, in all probability,
from that of the Chalcidian and Dorian colonies of Cam-
pania and Sicily. To this it owes the form of the letter L, Ι
of C for Γ, of X for Ξ, and the retention of the Koppo in the
form Q. The Roman alphabet consisted originally of
twenty-,one signs, A, Β, C, D, E, F, Z, H, l, K, L, M, N, X,
Ο, Ρ, Q, R, S, T, V. The signs θ, mdo not appear as
letters, but are kept as the symbols of notation for 100, 1000,

50 ; though in the case of the first two the form of the ·

symbol is assimilated to that of the initial letters 0f centum
and mille. The digamma keeps its proper place and sign,
but it has a fresh value, that of the hard labial spirant, a
sound unknown to Greek. The letter Z is found in the
