u] Analogy. 7

shews book, books, following the analogy ol words which form
the plural in s. The preterite of the ΑΒ. verb ridan was in
the singular rod, rz'ole, nid, pl. nilon. Modern English has
throughout rode (zrdd).

These then will serve as instances of the working of
Analogy in altering the forms of words. It acts alongside
of memory in creating new words on the model of old, and
in bringing words related in meaning into conformity with
one another.

Forms due to the aetion of analogy are numerous in the
later stages of a language‚ but we are not to suppose that the
power of creating new lorms on the model ol old was denied
to the earlier stages. As the organs ol speech were the -
same, so we must suppose the mental conditions to have
been. The reasons which led to a change of language in
the past must have been the same as the reasons which lead
to changes ol language now.

These two principles ol Phonetic Law and Analogy are ol
supreme importance in the study of language. Under the
first we learn that changes of sound talre place in obedience
to general laws, and that every word, in which the same
sound occurs under the same conditions, is subject to the
same phonetic change. Under the second we leam that new
words are created and old words changed in obedience to
their supposed resemblance to other words or groups ol
words.
