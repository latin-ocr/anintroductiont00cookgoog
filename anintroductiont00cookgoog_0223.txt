.x.] Mood in Dependent Clausen arr .

not but what the indicative in a final clause is strictly
speaking an absurdity, but the expression of past· time is
essential to the sentence, and past time can only be expressed
in the indicative.

With regard to Latin the question is at present probably
insoluble. We can see that the subjunctive is used in oratio
obliqua, because by the nature of the case the statement is
distinctly made not as a fact, and therefore the indicative is
inappropriate. But until some satisfactory result is arrived
at as to the origin of the so-called subjunctive in Latin, till
we can say confidently whether the imperfect, the most im-
portant tense, is in origin a subj. or an opt. (or, what is
perhaps possible, a form corresponding neither in origin nor
in meaning precisely to either mood as we know thern in
other languages) the question of the precise meaning con-
veyed by the employment of the mood is best left in
abeyance.

However, the use of the subj. in oratio obliqua in Latin
and of the optative in Greek is only the expression in those
particular languages of a principle that is common to other
indo-European languages. The machinery employed is no
doubt different in the several cases. Greek uses the opta-
, tive after ὅτι and ὡς in historic sequence, but also avails
itself to a large extent of the infinitival constructione, and in
primary sequence with ὅτι or br simply quotes the words of
the original speaker, merely adapting the person to the new
circumstances. Latin restricts the subj. to dependent clausor,
elsewhere using the inf„ which it even extends to some types
of reported question. Modern German, with some limita-
tions, uses the subjunctive in clauses not introduced by the
narrative dara. ln every case the feeling which leads to the
use of the mood is plainly that the assertionis not made
with sufficient confidence to warrant the indic. The state·
ment is not vouched for as true, but only put as probably or
possibly true. The subj. and opt. may therefore be classed
