Trur InuoEunoennw Lexouioss.

Trrs greater part of the languages and dialects of Europe
as well as a certain number of Asiatic languages‚ can be
grouped together as common descendants ofa single parent·
speech. The names of Aryan, Indo-Europam, and Indo-
Germam'c are all applied to this community of languages

The term ‘Indo-Germanic' omits all notice of Greek and
Latin as well as of the Celtic and Slavonic languages; the
term ‘Aryan,' or better ‘Arian’ is also applied in a more
limited sense to the group formed by Indian and lrauian lan·
guages. We shall therefore employ the term Indo-European.

The Indo-European family consists of eight groups or
smaller families of language‚ two of which are to be found in
Asia and the rest in Europe.

Indisn and 1. The Indian and Iranian group. Of the Indian Sanskrit

lranian.

is the head. Sanskrit is the ancient literary language of the
priestly caste of the Brahmans. The oldest form of Sanskrit
(from c. 1500 nc.) appears in the Vedas or sacred hymns3 the
later or classical Sanskrit is the language which conformed
to the rules of the native grammarians.

The Iranian or Persian consists of the Old Persian, the
language of the cuneiform inscriptions, and the Zend or Old

Bactrian, which is the language of the Zend-avesta or sacred
books of Zoroaster.
