tion remains in Sanskrit and Greek. In Latin the pas-
sive in -r is comparatively rarely used in a middle sense;
buta large number ol the deponents formed with the same
suffix are undoubtedly middle in origin (utor, vescor, pou'or,
etc).

Not all verbs in Greek and Sanskrit appear in both voices.
(ι) Some roots appear only or mainly in the active, e. g.
asos εἰμι’, estha φύω, algo βαίνω. (a) Others appear only in
the middle, e. g. asos ἧμαι, assi κεῖμαι. (3) Others again, ol
which there are many in Sanskrit, have both an active
and a middle voice, e. g. rtem, φέρω, etc. In some verbs,
eg. θέω, θεύσομαι, the active is appropriate to one tense-stem,
the middle to anot t.her '

Active verbs are either (r) Transel' t,rve i. e. they require, The ncnve

e‚g.,rpe'yu, I run. Sometimes an active verb can have both
transitive and intransitive meanings, eg. ἐλαύνω with an
object is transitive and means drioe, while without an object
it is intransitive and means march; and so in Latin with
ruo. We might then, instead os distinguishing transitive
and intransitive verbs, speak only ol the transitive and in·
transitive uses of verbs, though from the meaning os their
roots some verbs are naturally transitive and others intransi-
tive, and were so in the original language.

ln the case ol ἐλαύνω it would seem that the object is suppressed
rather than that the verb is, strictly speaking, ever intransitive. The
Latin duco is used in the same way, and both usages seem to belong to
the language os the camp, and thence have passed into the language os
writers who dealt with military matters.

In the Middle Voice the subject is represented as The
acting for himself or upon hrinsels. We can distinguishjljjcdje
the following uses as common to Sanskrit, Greek, and, in

some degree, to Latin. (ι) The reflexim sense, where the
