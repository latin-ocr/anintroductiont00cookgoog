⁶4 Aspirate'on in Latin.

Medially between vowels it is commonly lost, and so we
have vemens and vehemens, m'l and nt'b1'13 prendo, probeo,
praebeo and prehendo, prohibeo, praehabeo, etc, It is also lost,
e. g. in :-

meiosmeibyp, Greek ὀμιχεῖν; amabo, Greek bx-aee3 nivis=
nibeis, Greek νὶφα; brevis=oreby2h Greek βραχύς.

The aspirate however was as unstable a sound in Latin as
in Greek or in modern English. In some words, where it
ought to appear, itis never found, eg. in anser, which a com-
parison ol χήν, English garder, shews ought to be hanser. ln
other cases the spelling· with or without the b is almost
equally well authenticated‚ as in harena beside arena, hedera
beside edera. But on the whole the tendency of Latin is to
insert the aspirate irregularly. We are told that in the
second century after Christianus, sepulchrum, lacbrumae,
cbenturio became common3 and much earlier Catullus ridi-
cules the custom in the well-known epigram-

Chommoda dicebat si quando eanemoda vellet
Dicere et imt'dias Arrius binsedios.
t ὕ * ss Ι

Hoc misso in Syriam requierunt omnibus aures
e e a e r
Cum subito affertur nuntius horribilis,
Ionios fluetus postquam illie Arrius isset
Jam uon Iam'os esse sed Hionios.
