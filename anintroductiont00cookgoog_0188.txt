176 The Accusatr'va. [ct.

as itis called in Priscian, or secondly passive, ie. the case ol
τὸ αἰτιατόν, the efflet, lor which the Latin is ffctzhus. The
relation in which the accusative stands to the verb with which
it is constructed depends upon the meaning ol the verb.
The main distinction to be drawn is between the accusatives
ol the External and Internal object. In the one the action
of the verb is directed to something outside of, and distinct j
lrom the meaning ol the verb; in the other the accusative ἵ
repeats more or less completely the meaning ol the verb.
For instance in ε’λκοε ὅ με οὔτασε the acc. ἕλκος repeats the
meaning contained in οὔτασε and may be called internal‚
while με’ is altogether distinct from and outside the meaning
of the verb and may be called external.
The ordinary use ol the Externa] Accusative, as the case
of the object with transitive verbs, requires no illustration.
The number ol such accusatives is very great, and they can
only be classified according to the different sorts of verbs
with which they are constructed. ln Sanskrit and Latin
these accusatives are sometimes used with nouns with a
verbal meaning, e. g. nomina agentes, in such instanees as ξ
justa orator (Plautus). Ol similar origin is the construction of
the accusative alter the forms of the infinitive (p. 146), after
participles and in Latin after gerunds, supines and verbal ad÷
jectives in -bundus, all of which are nominal in origin, though
they have become absorbed into the verbal conjugation.
Other uses of the extemal accusative, which may be reckoned
as Indo-European, are the accusat. ol the tammus ad quem·
or object to which motion is directed, eg. ἔρχεσθον κλισίαν
(Homer); Laremque venz't litora (Virgj We need not suppose
that this use is anything more thana special instance of the
’ ordinary use ol the accusat serving to complete the meaning
ol averb ol motion towards a plac'e by indicating the goal,
just as with verbs of motion from, e.g. φεύγω, fugio, it indi·
cates the point ol departure. External too is the Accusatr'vus
de quo, of the person, that is, about whom anything is said or
