Indo-European AI, Α U. 33

but the Attio and Ionic dialects represented this a
by η, e. g. μήτηρ. The same η bas also to represent
lIndo-European ε’, as in θῆ-σω. In the seminines ol
declension, where ᾶ was original, Attic preservesn
v, ρ, while lonic does not even do this. Attic κόρη,
for eoppa, tipfp, and are no exceptions to the rule.

The original diphthong ai is frequent in the oldest Latin
inscriptions and survives even in those of the time of the
Empire‚ both in the body ola word and also in the suffixes
os cases, ln the inscriptions on the tombs os the Scipios
e. g. (ac. 250—150 cire), we find aniz'lz's, atiie (aedem), Gnathod
(Gnaeo), quairatis3 but side by side with the last form in the
same inscription we find aelate. That this sorm ai however
was originally dissyllabic is proved by its scansion in the
older poets (e. g. magnai rei pablicaz' gronii Plaut. Mil. 103 ;
a scansion which became a traditional archaism in poetry,
e.g. Aen. 3. 354, 6. 747). The diphthong passed into the
monophthong about ac. 200-150, and was written ae ; but
' the spelling αἱ long survived, especially in the legal style,
though it cannot be supposed to represent in the ordinary
language any difference in pronunciation. In originally
unaccented ‘syllables and in composition ae becomes i, e. g.
mensori becomes mensis, and caedo incido.

The Latin diphthong au may either represent an original
diphthong or be a secondary product. ln this latter case
it is the regular representative of an original ou, as for
example ι
