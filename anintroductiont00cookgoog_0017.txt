have been different in its statement, but would have been
equally valid.

Phonetie Laws are most easily observed in uncivilised
nations, for with them the conservative influence ol literature
does not exist. Change is more frequent and more general,
and in some savage tribes so rapid that one generation
cannot understand another. In civilised nations change is
controlled by literature and tradition, sometimes even entirely
checked, in which case the language becomes dead, as has
been the late of Classical Latin. The healthy state of a
living language is to he in equilibrium between the revolu-
'tionary and the conservative forces, ,

It may appear that there are exceptions to a Phonetie
Law. For instance, in Greek it is a law that σ between
vowels disappears, but yet there are such words as χαρίεσι
which are exceptions to the law. Or again, a law which
holds good in ordinary speech may be obscured when
written in the spelling ol literature. Or again, a word may
he borrowed from another language or dialect, and so not
fall under the law of the language into which it has been
adopted.

Many of the apparent exceptione to the phonetic laws ol Analogy.
any language are due to the influence of Analogy. A con-
siderable number ol the words we use we have never
actually learnt, but rather formed in imitation of other forms
previously heard or used. Memory is not the sole agent in
our speech. The power of association is another anda
powerful one. Everyone must know how a child beginning
to talk inflects its verbs upon the model ol one or two
already known to it. ln the ease of an adult these new
formatione are less common, for knowing more he has less
need of thern, but still it is possible for him to use in con-
versation a word which he has never heard or seen, but
