(Old Lat. stim), ninus, velem, nolim, dmin (cf. δοῖμεν), etc. The
forms in sim, as faxim, etc. are optatives of a sigmatic aorist
(cf. eldet'vyvzcldwuyv, p. 143).

The existing forms of the Imperative are as follows :

(ι), The pure verb stem-ama, rege, ser.

(2) The suffix ·lo'(d), explained as the ablative singular
of the pronominal stem ta used as an enclitic addition
to the verb form with the meaning from that tinae on-
words, and therefore serving to distinguish the future
imperative.

(3) The so-called pseudo-conjunctives with secondary
endings—regite, regunlo, regere (cf. ἔπαυε imno, Lat. sequere),
and with the passive suffix reguntur.

(4) The participial or infinitive fonn, legwm’m‘ correspond-
ing either to the Greek λεγόμενοι or λεγέμεναι.

amatote is apparently formed from amalo on the analogy of
amate from ama.

The termination of the infinitivo active is plainly -se, which
between vowels becomes -re (es-se, ama-re). There are some
indications that the vowel was originally long, and the cor-
responding Greek type seems to be -σαι (thaat), though it is
not easy to see how a final diphthong could become e'in
Latin. To this answers the Sanskrit dative of nouos in -as
or -s used infinitivally‚ eg. jz'vdse, jis! from fluas, jis. Latin
apparently, as also sometimes Sanskrit‚ uses the locative

rather th'an the dative infinitivally(cf. Greek δόμεν, a suffixless ,
locative), and the suffix -ἴ becomes -ἕ just as mari becomes ¹

mord. nabere will therefore bea locative of a substantival
stem vairos, nabes, and formed like jr'vdsc from sivos. But
it would seemthat the termination must eventually have been
taken to be -se‚ ·re not ·e alone, for it is not easy to suppose
that monere, amare originated in any other way than by
attaching -re as a suffix to mona, ama. The double ss of
the perfect infinitive still awaits explanation, though plainly
