4 Phonetic Laws [oh.

true that no one can pronounce the same sound twice in
exactly the same way, because ol the imperfection of the
organs of speech. No one can sign his name toa cheque
twice without minute differences between the two signatures‚
but the signatures are for practical purposes the same,
otherwise one cheque might be dishonoured. Similarly
though no two sounds pronounced are exactly the same, yet
they are the same for practical purposes, and are recognised
as the same by those whom we addresS, otherwise they
would have no meaning. lt is the possibility of infinite
variation in the utterance os any sound that gives the oppor-

fact that sounds appear to be the same, and that a man ol
sixty may think that they are pronounced as they were when
he was thirty, yet they have changed by gradations which
are imperceptible to those who employ thern. Itis neces-
sary to lay stress on this, because changes of sound are
unconscious. ll h disappeared in English it would not be
because those who spoke English agreed to drop it for the
sake os ease, or from sudden motives of laziness, but it
would disappear gradually and imperceptibly.

nunciation ol the k-sound changes, it will not change in one
particular word only, but the conditions being the sarne, it
will change in all words in which it occurs. Hence it is that
we are enabled to call the change a Phonetic Law which
