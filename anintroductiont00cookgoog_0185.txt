well as their own. The Dative in Greek in so lar as it has
absorbed the Locative is local, but in its other uses it is a
grammatical case. The Genitive again is in Greek a mixed
case, because in so lar as it is Ablatival it expresses local
relations, while in its other uses it is grammatical. In Latin
the Ablative is mixed, lor it is local in so far as it expresses
place, and grammatical in so far as it expresses the instrument
or manner of the verbal action.

The following table represents roughly the extent to which
the eight cases oi the original language have become fused in

the derived languages :—
Latin. Indo-Europam. Greek.

Nom. Nominative Nom.
Voc. Vooetive Voc.
Ace. Accusative Ace.
Dat. Dative

Instrumental Dat.
Abl. ἱ Locative

Ablative y
Gen. Genitive

It must be understood that we are here using the names ol the cases
as they are ordinarily employed in the grammars, without raising the
question es to whether e. g. the abl. sing. in -ἱ ol the 3rd decl. in Latin
is not in origin an instrumental.

Gen.

How did this fusion ol the cases corne about? The
answer may be sought in two different directions—

1. Looking to the forms of the cases, we may notice such
facts as the following. The Sanskrit possesses a distinct
form lor the abl. sing. only in the O-declension; everywhere
else it uses one form lor the gen. and abl„ thus coinciding
with Greek. The existence in Latin, on the other hand, ol
ablatives oi the 3rd decl. like morell, may partly account for
the non-absorption ol that case in Latin. Throughout
Sanskrit there is but one lorrn lor the dat. and abl. plural,
and the same is true of Latin. In the dual even Sanskrit
only possesses three forms, a nom. voc. acc„ an instr. dat.
abl„ and agen. loc.
