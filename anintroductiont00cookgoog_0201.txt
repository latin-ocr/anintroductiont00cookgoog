Sanskrit the augment is the sign of past time, differences of
time are appropriate to the Indicative alone, and in the other
moods a differenee of tense-stem has another significance than

aorist a momentary action, and these are distinctions which
can be expressed by these tense-stems in whatever meod they
appear. Not all verbal roots admit of the formation of all
the different tense-stems. Some have only one, e. g. pres.

therefore nearest to a timeless tense, as in such a sentence as
Man is morlal. It can also denote an action as going
on at the time ol speaking, e. g. γράφω, Ι am wriling.
Besides this, which is its proper meaning, ‚the present can
be used of past events in the idiom of the Historic pre-
sent, which is common in Latin and Greek (though not in
Homer ¹). It can also be used of future time in prophecies
In the use of the historic present the speaker transports him·
