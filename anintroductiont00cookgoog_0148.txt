sse Perfeci.

The stem oi the Periect appears in Greek in all the
· Moods of the Active and Middle Voioe, and also in

the Pluperfect Indicative. It is characterised by special

Person Endings (p. 122) and reduplication of the Stem. ι

There are also 'traces of an original variation ot' the stem,
which was strong in the singular and weak in the plural.

’- (ι) In roots beginning with a single consonant, the syllable ¹
⁰ ' of reduplication consists of this consonant with ε, e. g. δέ-

δορκατ οι where the root begins with an aspirate, ol the
corresponding tenuis with ε, as in τέ-θεικα.

(a) Where the root begins with a Mnte and a Nasal or
Liquid, the first consonant with ε is the syllable of redupli-
cation, as in γε’-γραπται, τὲ-θνῃκιι To this ἔγνωκα is aconstant
exception, and ἐβλάστηκα beside βεβλάστηκα. 111 Cretan in-
scriptions ἐγραμμὲνος is found.

In other cases of two initial consonants it was usual to ,
prefix ε only, as in ἴκιημαι (κέκτημαι is also found), ἐζευγμέναι,
&nopae Stems beginning with ρ prefix ε, alter which ρ is
doubted, e. g. torva, irem

(3) Where the root began with a single spirant, in Homer
we have ε forreduplication‚ as in ἐ-ελμένος for ξε-ξελμενος, and
so too in ἔ-οικα and ἔ-ολπα. Ιιι attic we have the ε in έιΐλωκιι,
ἔοικα, ἅνέῳγμαι.

(4) An εἰ· appears in εἴληφα, εἴληχα, which resemble
εἴρηκα from tsfrp. The regular forms appear in the lonic
λελάβηκα, λέλογχα.

(5) Where the root began with a vowel we find the redu-
plication represented either by a long vowel, as ln ἤσκηται, οι
else by the socalled Attic reduplication.
