CHAPTER V.

Cossowms

’ We pass on after the Semivowels to the Censonante and κ
ol these take first the Mum ot Explon‘ee Consonants‚ in the 3
pronunciation ol which there is a check in the passage of the
breath through the mouth.

Velarand The Gustumls are the mutes whose place ol articulation is 2
gffffils furthestback in the breath passage. Two kinds of gutturals
may be distinguished, those in which the tongue and the soft
palate (velum) are the organs ol articulation, i. e. the Veler ¹
Gutturale and those in which the tongue and the hard
palate are the organs ol ai‘ticulation, i. e. the Palelol Gutturols ¹
or Palatels. These two sets of sounds are distinct in origin
and treatment.

The difference in mode of articulation may be illustrated
by the English ‘kin' and ‘coel,’ in the former of which the
guttural is pronounced nearer the lront ol the mouth than in
the latter.

Besides Gutturals we have, as we have seen (p. 1'9), the
Denta! and the Lebz'al Mutes, All these are also distin-
guished into Tenues (Hard) and Mediae (Soti), which can be
aspirated as well as unaspirated‚ and thus we get the Hard
Aspe'rates or Aspe'rated Tenues kh, th, ph, and the Sost
Aspe'rales or Aspz'rated Mediae gh, dle, be. It is not often
that languages have both sets ol Aspirated Mutes in lull.

The following table shews the notation adopted for the
different Mutes or explosives in this book :—
