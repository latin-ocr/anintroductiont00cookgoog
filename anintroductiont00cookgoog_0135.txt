un] Person Endings. 123

conjugation generally. It also appears in the Epic έθελρσι,
ἄγῃσι, etc, but here the iota subscript points to an extension
of the proper ending byan external addition. The ending is
almost confined to the Homerie poems and exists side by
side with the normal -ῃ,

ln the thematic conjugation we have the ending -ιι in the
Pres, e. g. φέρει, Sanskrit blera-ti. The corresponding form
to the Sanskrit would in Greek be φιρετι, and this according
to rule would pass to φιρισι. But φέρεις, φέρει seem to have
secondary endings, -e, -τ with preceding ι like optat. φέριιι-ς,
<lieet-f )·

(2) Secondary ending originally -τε-έφιρι(τ), Sanskrit
abbaram φέροι(τ), Sanskrit bddret.

The tremains in Latin (e. g. erat), but according to rule
has disappeared in Greek. Latin has -tin the perfect cecedit
where Greek has only -ι, as in οἶδε, Sanskrit vida.

The ending of the third sing. of the sigmatic aorist is -e,
just as in the third sing. of the perfect. Thus έδειιι-σε (ἕδειξι),
is like the perfect οἶδ-ι, and has not the same vowel as
ἐδεικ-σας (ἔδειξας).

Fire Person Plural.

The ending in Attic in both primary and historical tenses First plur.
is -ρεν, In Doric we find the ending -ριι, In Sanskrit we act.
have primary ·mas, secondary ·ma.

The Sanskrit -mas and the Latin -mus appear to point to
a primary ending in s. ln both Greek and Latin there is but
one ending for all tenses.

Second Person Plural.

Primary and Secondary ending -τε, Sanskrit has primary Second
-tha, secondary -tca pm·

In the perfect -θε is the ending immediately after the full ·
root, eg. Epic κέιρρχ-θε. Elsewhere we have -τε, e. g.
πεπόνθα-τε.
