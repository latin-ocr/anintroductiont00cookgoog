as potential; and it is natural to compare such usages as the
French conditional, ‘il aurai! ὰ peu prlr doudll' (ir should
have doubled=it r's said to dave), and the German ‘Es soll
wahr seth?

It may be further noticed that in all three languages the
mood thus used gradually ceased to be employed in main
clauses in a potential sense. In classical Greek the potential
optative is practically only found with dv: the ‘pure’
potential subj. is very limited in its use in Latin and unknown
in German. ln this way it would easily come to pass that
the subj. (opt.) came to be regarded simply as the mood
appropriate to dependent clauses in such cases.

As to the construction in oblique narrative we can trace
a distinct development even in the Greek and Latin litera-
ture that has come down to ue.

As regards Greek we may say that the optative is found in
Homer representing a dubitative subj. aiter a past tense,
as in·-

δΐζεγὶρήὲ μάχοιτο . . ἦ λαοὺς ...ὁμοκλήσειεη
and in indirect questions, such as·-

νημερτές ἐνίσπες alnos . . . ὑπεκπροφύγοιμι,

but is unknown in oblique statement after ὅτι (ὅ), eto, though
cases like Ζεὺς . . οἶδε . . el κε’ μιν ἀγγείλαιμι indu . . afford
the model (apart from the opt. after a primary tense),
which may have originated the later construction with ὅτι.
Similarly in Latin we can trace a development between

, Plautus and Cicero in the treatment of indirect questions,

The De·

Plautus often preferring to employ the words ol the original
question, and not sully subordinating it asa dependent clause.
