148 Person'Endr'ngs't [cu.

·mi‚ -si, -tihave everywhere disappeared, and their place has
been taken by the Secondary endings -m, -s‚ -Ι, Oi the
augment there are few traces left The middle endings as
such have vanished‚ and in their place we find a medio-

passive inflexion formed by adding -r to the ‘secondary’ f
middle endings (·lu1'lur= ductor, cf. λύετο). The system of ’

the sigmatic aorist has been confounded with that of the
perfect, and the resulting inflexion, while it combines the
perfect and coristic meanings‚ often shews also a combination
of perfect and aoristic forms Ι

The person-endings are as follows :—

’ 1st sing. in non-thematic verbs -m, in thematic verbs -ὁ, r
⁶ ⁰ The single instance of -m in a primary tense os the indicative ¹

is the form sum, but as this form is perhaps better explained
by being compared with Gk. ἔον (εἰσ-ον), and would seem
therefore to be properly a secondary tense, it would perhaps be
better to reiuse to recognise the existence ol -m as a prirnary
ending in Latin except in the subjunctive and in some future
indicatives which are subjunctive in origin. Inquam is better
taken to be an imperfect and therefore secondary. All other

non-thematip verbs have, at any rate in this person, become y

thematic in Latin.

The termination -o is as yet unexplained3 but if the ex·
planation of the Greek 1st person in -ω suggested p. 122 is
correct, the Latin ending must have a distinct origin. -oy'gz
in Latin could only become viem, and eventually perhaps
-um. The sk. bhdrcimt' with long ᾶ points to an original
'form hieromi, of which the corresponding secondary form
would be flerem = Lat. feri, though the loss of m is hard to
account for.

rud sing. -s (fir-s, ama-s). 3rd sing. -t (fer-l, ama-l).

1st plur. ·mur, differing from Greek -μεν, but in its con·
sonants corresponding to the Doric -μεε and perhaps in
every respect to Sk. ·mas. ’
