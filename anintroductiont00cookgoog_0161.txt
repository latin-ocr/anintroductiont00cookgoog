and plur. div, which perhaps corresponds to the Str. dual
ending -thas, with the hard aspir‘ate becoming a tenuis after
an unaccented syllable. The earlier plural ending ·te‚ Gk.
·τε, Sk. -ἰΙια, appears in the imperative (es-te, fer-te).

grd plur. ·nt (ama-nt, doce-nt, reg-o-nt).

The passive terminations are obscure, but this much isPassive
certain, that they are formed in most cases by the addition of {33ss}
a suffix -rto unaugmented forms of the tenses with the
secondary middle suffiri. Legr'tur,leguntur cannot he separated . '
from he'yrro, λέγοντο. Legeris seems lo correspond lo *heyeoo
(λέγον), standing for legero-r, though the final -r's may be due ’
rather to an assimilation to the ending of the corresponding
person of the active. But legere looks like the same form
without the ·r; at least we cannot separate the ‘injunctive’
(imperative) ἕπου (ἔπεσα) from sequere. Legimur may con·
ceivably stand for legemus-r, which would become legemurr, =
legemur, hut this cannot be considered as satisfactory.
legimini is universally explained as participial (cf. λεγόμενοι),
but the corresponding form of the imperative is perhaps to
he compared with the Greek infinitive λεγέμεναι, which is

used in Homer, under certain limitations, asan imperative.
