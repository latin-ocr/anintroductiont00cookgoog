identical in origin with the similar forms of the pluperfect
subjunctive.

The Latin agi cannot well be separated from the Sanskrit
aye, a dative used infinitivally. amari on the other hand
would not find its parallel in Sanslrrit, which only uses the
datives of root-nouus in this sense. lt is just possible
that agi stands for agie (as fili for filie), an instrumental
or locative (17:42, cf. abietis) from an I-stem. ie would be
kept when followedby the passive suffix ·r, but without this
suffix would pass to -ῑ, Hence agi, agur, whence by
analogons formation amari, amarz‘er.

In Sanskrit the most common type of infinitive is the
accusative of substantives with the suffix -tu (etum, ete). To
this corresponds the Latin ‘supine in -um' used as an
infinitive after verbs of motion. lt is to be noticed that in
practice the vowel gradation of the supine is identical with
that of the past participle, but originally the ‘supine’ was
formed with a strong, the participle with a weak stem (supine
ei-tu-m, part. i-ta-m). The two forms have reacted on one
another.

the case of euntis (cpont-h), sons (s-onl-r, a present participle
ossum, cf. Greek ὤν), and one or two Old Latin words. But
a trace of the O·degree is seen in sacricndus (for saciant-nor)
by the side of the later sacr'endus, which is formed by the
addition of a second participial suffix -uos (Gk. ἁγνός, Lat.
ple-nus) to the stem of the present participle. Ι

a. The Future Participle in -turur is peculiar to Latin, and
is clearly formed from the nomina agentzi in -tor (daturusz ’
dator) with an unexplained change of ο· and τὶ, also seen in
sur, Gk. φώρ, etc. (p. 36). The desideratives in -urio
