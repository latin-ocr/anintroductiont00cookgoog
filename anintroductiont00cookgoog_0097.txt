tions in anastrophe. Ζεύς ἐστι only differs from Ζεὺς ἔστι in
the meaning os the words in the sentence; considered
separately the words are identical. Similarly θεὸς ὣς and ὡς
θεός, παρὰ θεοῦ and θεοῦ πάρα are phrases consisting ol pre-
cisely the same words.

Enough has been said to shew that in any inquiry into the
question ol accent we must take account not merely ol syl-
labic but also oi sentence-accent. We can now go on to
consider the phenomena of accent as they are presented to
us in the Greek language. The system we lind in Greek or
any other Indo-European language is developed from the
system that prevailed in the original language, as is proved
by Verner's law; the development is in accordance with
strict phonetic law, and any apparent irregularity must be
explained by the action of analogy.

Now the system of accentuation presented to us by Greek The law
is governed by the law os three syllables. By this law the olfihffie
acute accent may not recede larther from the end of a word m Greek.
than the antepenultimate, or, in cases where the last syllable
is long, than the penultimate syllable. ln technical language‚
the recessive accent‚ i. e. the accent which does not fall on
the last syllable, is limited to three syllables or three morae,
a mora being the quantity of a short vowel, and a long vowel
being equivalent to two morae. To this law, which is other·
wise universal, there are two cases ol apparent exception.

(ι) ln the case of words with a trochaic ending the acute
accent may tall on the fourth mora from the end, eg. in·
ὅζωστος, ἤπειρος. This exception at present remains unex-
plained, but it is to be noticed that some ol the words which
are included in it were originally accented according to the
ordinary rule. Thus τροπαῖον has the older, τρόπαιον the later
accent, in Homer we have ἀχρεῖος, in Attic ἅχρειος, etc.

(a) In the caseos spondaic words like κήπου, the accent
salls on the second mora of the tirst syllable (κεέπου), and so
the exception is only apparent.
