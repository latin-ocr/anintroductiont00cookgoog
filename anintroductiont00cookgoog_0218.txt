Purpose (Fmal clauses strictly so called), but also clauses ol
Conseqoenoe and object-clauses of the type δείδιε μὴ λαιμὸν
duagium, etc.

2. Conditional choses are normally placed before the
main clause aud their action was therefore conoeived ol as

prior to that ol the main clause. Syntactically they are
distinguished by the fact that they are regarded from the

point ol view of tbe time ol the speaker. They will include κ

all clauses oi condition, hypothesis, circumstance, and the
like.

These two groups ol clauses are not always introduced by

special particles For example, the relative clauses both in
Greek and Latin belong to both groups, according to their
meaning in the partictdar sentence in which they occru.
Similarly ut in its final and consecutive uses belongs to the
first head, in its temporal and concessive usages to the
second ; ἵνα, in order that, is final, ba, where, is conditional.
The subjunctive in final clauses is evidently the subjunctive
ol will, and the optative in Greek in similar clauses is the

optative os wish or expectation. The only remarkable thing

in the usage is, that whereas the clause is strictly only appro-
priate aster a first person or an imperative (which is still the
most common type in Homer), it comesto be used of the
purpose ofa third person, even where the speaker has no
intluence in the question

Thus from

allow ἠέ τφ εὖχος ὀρέξομεν ἠέ τις ἡμῖν,
it is an easy step to
elatrat ij ῥα rol olor ἐπίστηται πολεμίζειν,

where the subjunctive is analogous to the subjunctive in indirect
questions in Latin. Where the purpose is that of another
or the event is past, the feeling of will or assurance is out of
place, but an expression of expectation is less inappro'priate.
Accordingly we get the optative in such cases as:
