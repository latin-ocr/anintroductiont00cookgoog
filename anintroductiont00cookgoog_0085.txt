2. lnitial say sometimes passes into s, probably again only lnitial sp.
in the first instance when the final preceding consonant made

it necessary.

3. An original dental‚ hard, soit, or aspirated, followed by Double
t, becomes ss, which altera long vowel is written s. Dentals.

This is the explanation ol the past participles in ·sus, the
original termination being, as in Greek, -tua

Hence, mlt-tus passes to adesum scld-tus to sclsrus3 judit-tus to
jassus, but ard-tus to visus3 racd-tus to caesam vatent-timus to vicin-
srmus. veceszmus.

lap-sur, etc, instead ol lap-tus, is the result oi analogy.

The same combinations before r become str, eg.

rod-trum passes to rostrum tend-trix to tomtn'xt pedet-tris to
pedestris.

4. Medial combinations of mutes ol a different character Medial
either assimilare, as mostly in composition, or one is dropped Mures.
and the preceding vowel lengthened, as infibula (figo), posse-
cur (pertzii-ea), etc. But little is as yet certain on this subject.

5. Medial combinations ol spirants before a solt mute Medial
or voiced consonant lose the spirant; the preceding vowel, spirants.
ir aceented, is long ; if unaccented, is short.

isdem passes to idem arisdire (cf. auris) to addire. But sdtr'sne
passes to sdtln; videmus (Sk. avedeima) to vidimus,

ό. Initial dy· becomes j, at any rate in Jupiter, Sk. Dydus. Mutes and

Initial dp becomes b in bellum, bis. {32ng

lnitial sm, sn lose the s, as σν does always and σμ some· ’
times in Greek.

mica, μικρός, oningin nix, Engl. summ mordere, σμερδ-νός, Engl.
smart.

·sr- medially becomes -br·, as in funeb-ris (furter), conso-
brinus (consecr-inus, from the stem ol soror), etc.

stl· becomes apparently successively scl·‚ sl-, and l·. The

spellings stlir, selei, and lis are all found.
