{Locativat The locative use of the ablative is widely distributed in
Latin. Besides the type Carthagine, Athenis, etc., we have
pendere antimi, tenere sc castres, sedere soleo, deiecere pugno, and
the ablatives alter nz'ti¹ confidere, stare (promissis), etc. Itis
used in a temporal sense in mane, nocte, etc. (Greek ἤματι,

νυκτί . l

Tlre ‘ablative absolute' is evidently not a pure ablative‚ l
but rather as the Sanskrit sheWS, a locative, though no doubt
after the fusion of the locative and instrumental in Latin, it

acquires some of the meaning of the latter case. lt corres-
ponds therefore not to the Greek genitive absolute, but to
the dative ln Such cases as τί μοι ἢ νέον ἢ περιτελλομέναις
ὥραις πάλιν ἐξανύσας χρέως (Soph.)

Datne. seen (p. 104), are partly dative, partly locative, partly instru-
mental‚ and so it is with the functions of the dative. It is
therefore a mixed case. In Latin the instrumental and loca-
tive meaning have passed to the ablative‚ except where a
locative case, egdoni, still remains

(ι) The true dative expresses the person to or sor whom
something is done, as for instance with verbs of giving, siem·
ing, hoping, growing, etc., in Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek.
This requires no illustration. It also stands with nouns of
meaning similar to these verbs, e. g. ἐχθρός, φίλος, amr'cus,
etc., and with substantives in δῶρα τοῖς θεοῖς, etc.

A dative is used in Greek in a predicative sense with εἰμι’,
γίγνεσθαι, ὑπάρχειν, e. g. βουλομένῳ μοι’ ἔστιν, etc. This dative
in the case of nouus denoting things is in Greek very rare,
though common in Latin, eg. praesidio esre. In Greek the
infinitive takes its place (p. 146).

Another use of the true Dative is to stand in a looser con·
nexion with the predicative verb and denote the person
interested in or affected by its action. This is the Dotzirus
commodior Incommodr'. Thus while δέχομαί τινος means to
