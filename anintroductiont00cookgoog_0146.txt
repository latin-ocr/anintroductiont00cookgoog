The Aeolio κάλημι, opnor, φίλημι, othrim, φίλως may soem to sherr that
these denominatives belonged to the -μι conjugation. But these forms are
due to the analogy of such verbs as ἅημι, nixque, etc. On the analogy
of αἠμεν rose φίλημεν, on the analogy of κιχεῖην rose φιλείην, and simi·
larly with the forms φιλῆναι, φιλ-ἥμενος.

Other denominatives are θωρῆσσω (zeum-go), τεκταίνυ
:reug-go), τελέω (mmm-tur), ἐλπίζω (εέλπιδ-ιω).

In many cases the proper form of the nominal sternis
ignored, e. g. from κέρδος comes “mgr-go = κερδαίνω, from
ἄριστον comes ἄριστά-ωε», from μάντις comes punct-(rhum, from
νόμως comes vapra-gozsopico. These formations are due to
the analogy of other verbS, e. g. νομίζω to the analogy of
ἐλπίζω (ε’λπιδ-), μειλίσσω (μειλιχω) to that os κηρύσσω (mpure).
Partly too the neglect of the nominal stem is due to the fact
that certainnendings had a definite meaning. 'Thus verbs
in -οω are causative, verbs in -αω denote a state, and so to
make a brr'dgc is γεφυρ-όω, in spite of γέφυρα-. Verbs in -ευω
imply behaviour after the sashion of the subject denoted by
the stem, e. g. βασιλεύ-ω ‘ to behave like a βασιλεύ-ς,’ and so in
spite Of ἅρχων, ἱκέτης, we have dPXowfflr {hereri-(sp. Some·
times there are two nominal stems, e. g. in the Homeric
ἡνίοχων, ἡνιοχῆα (εὴνιοχημι), the latter of which gives a stem
ἡνιοχευ- for ἡνιοχεῦω.

‚Causatives There are other present stems of the sixth class made up
, of the O-degree of the root with suffixes ψ, ψ, answering
· to Sh. -dya-‚ e. g. T⁰ss·‘'(t)⁰’› ‹top-dom, etc. These verbs are

causative in meaning, and are to be distinguished from
denominatives in -εω, e. g. οἶκε-(θω, where the «belongs to
the root.

7. Stems (7) :lte Seventlr Closs ofPresenl Stems is made up oi the
with to, ‘t root and thesuffixes -το-, -τε-. This class is connected closely
with the Sixth. Thus a root ending in the labial π with the
addition of the suffiri -Αο- passes regrdarly into mo, e. g.
torpor-ro ἀστράπ-τω. Wherever then the root ends in π the
