111. Vowels again can be modified by founding or pro·
jecting the lips

The following are instances of the most familiar varieties
of vowel sounds. In firther theA isopen and the tongue
is at the back of the mouth or gustarat. In man and
dat we have the same vowel with the tongue in a lower
position.

In French fini the I is narrem, and the tongue is further
forward or palatal. The same vowel is open in English bit.
ln both sounds the vertical position of the tongue is high.

A narrow palatal E, with middle vertical position of the
tongue, is to be seen in French ltl, armet. The same vowel
is wide or open in English head, end. Of the vowel sounds

tongue‚ while the vowel is open in English good and full.

Α narrow guttural 0, with middle vertical position of the
tongue‚ is to be found in German so, Sohn, and with alow
vertical position in English lordl . A wide guttural 0,
with low vertical position of the tongue, oc'curs in English not

mouth passage at which they are articulated.

Furthest back we have the Gutture! sounds, with articu-

these are the sounds of hg before the vowel sounds a and o,
e. g. cumgente, and such sounds as the ch of German ach and

soft palate plays a prominent part in their articulation these
sounds are called Velar Gutturals.

Further forward we have the Palalals, which result from
