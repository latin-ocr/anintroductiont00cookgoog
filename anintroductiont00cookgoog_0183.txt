cost ol the dual, or else, where the plural is used, the notion
of both or a pair is not emphasised. As compared with
Sanskrit, it may be said that in Greek the plural can always
take the place of the dual.

Apart lrom the use of the dual of a noun by itsell to
signify a pair ol things, we have δύο to signily two things or
persons. Thus ἵππω would mean apar'r of horses in a
charior, δύο ἵππω would mean two horses from a herd. So in
Homer we have δύω θῆρε, λέοντε θύω, etc. Here again in
Greek the plural can be used, and it is not possible to say
whether this is a feature inherited irom the original language
or not.

We now come to the Cases (πτώσεις) ol the noun, in which cases.
the different relations ol the stem or main meaning oi the
noun to other parts ol the sentence are expressed hy
the addition of certain suffixos called case-endings. With
the Stoics the Nominative case was the ὀρθή or εὐθεῖα πτῶσις,
while the rest were πλαγίαι, oblique, and deviations from
the nominative. We now regard all caseS, including the
nominative or naming case, as inflexions ol the stem,
which provides the uninflected and unrelated meaning of
the noun. The cases found in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin
have already been enumerated‚ p. 103. The only limit to
the number ol cases in any language is the number of rela-
tions which those who employ the language express by
different cases. As the relations in which nouns can stand
to other parts of a sentence are very numerous, there can be
a great number ol cases. But in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin,
and consequently in Indo-European, these numerous relations
are grouped under a limited number of cases. For instance,
Greek and Latin once had eight cases, but some of these have
become obsolete. The Instrumental became obsolete, and its
uses were absorbed by the Ablative in Latin and the Dative
in Greek. Again, the Ablative disappeared in Greek, and its
