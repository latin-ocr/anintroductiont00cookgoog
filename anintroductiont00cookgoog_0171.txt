na] Futura aad Imperfect. 159

The future in -bo and the imperfect in -bam perhaps await Future and
a complete explanation. The traditional theory that the {vmffifeet
terminations represent respectively I.-E. bhpo (Gk. φὺω) and
bhpam (cf. ἐ-φύην) is hardly satisfactory, as the disappearance
of the p is hard to account for, and the meaning that would
naturally result by attaching such a verb form to a second
verbal stem is hardly satisfactory. But that the forms are
compounds seems certain, and the first clement is plainly
infinitive in character and answers to the first clement
in compounds like calefacti), arefacio (the first clement
of which Lucretius uses as a separate word, ‘facit

(ιη’).

Of the Latin terminatious -bo‚ -bam, the following explanation has
been suggested. The Greek βαίνω is I.·E. (ἐμέ, Lat, venio, Engl. come.
This supposes a root geg». But βέ-βᾶ-κα, fidu-v and βάκτρον hythe side
of baculum, which cannot be a horrowed word, seem to necessitate a
root elba, which may also appear in the English path, A.·S. preth.
The increase of a root by a guttural also appears in e. g. Ori-aoy
(aldhe'), fat-c-io. From the elba might be formed a present bo] an
unaugmented aorist ba'm (cf. sto', alstd, ἔστην), which were used as
suffixos to form the future of the 1 and 2 conjugations,and the imperfect
of all. In early Latin we also find forms like leni-bo, aud the imperfect
leni-bam, occasionally preserved in classical poetry‚ is more primitive
than leni-idam, where the long e· seems to have been introduced from
the and conjugufion, which apparently is also responsible for the length
of the vowel in regebam. The meaning is precisely that which is re·
quired. A future corresponding to that in -bo also appears in Celtic; ¹
the imperfect in -bam is peculiar to Latin.

The characteristic vowel of the thematic present subjunctive The Con-
is apparently ᾶ, andserat‚sera'mus are accordingly primitiveluncfile'
The type videreris a sigmatic aorist subjunctive, correspond-
ing to the Greek εῖδέ(σ)ω.

amem perhaps stands for ama-iam and isan optative
(p. 143), and the same explanation may possibly hold good
for the future rege's (reg-r'l-s), whence was formed the plural
regimus, etc. (for *reg-ianus). ⁴

The optative suffixes-sing. -r'e‘-‚ pl. -i--are seen in stin
