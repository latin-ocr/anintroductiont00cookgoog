x.] The Optab‘ve. 197

obtaining, while wall implies the intention to obtain what is
within your power.

The optative can signify: (1) Wish, eg. τεθναίην, mortar, (a) wisi.
ηιαγ I dee, in all persons. In Latin it is in this use indistin-
guishable from the subjunctive, As a kind os mild impera·
tive especially in the and pers. we have πίθοιό μοι (Homer). A
negative wish is expressed by the addition οῐμῆ, Latin ne, eg. pr)
γένοιτο. (a) In a milder sense ol acquiescence or concession
we have the optative in αὖτις Ἀργείην Ἑλένην Mcveltuos ἄγοιτο
(Homer), Menelaus may take Helen back. Ne sintin senectute
ae'res, e't may be that old age is feeble. Here also may be set
the clauses with quamvis and licet, which are properly clauses
signifying, ‘as much asyou please,’ ‘it is eonceded.'

All the above uses may be regarded as belonging to the
weil meaning of the optative, in which it inclines to the sense
oia mild imperative. Only the first is to be found in Attic

’ Greek, where the pure optative in independent sentences is
only used to express wish, either with or without εἴθε, εἰ γάρ.
Similarly in Latin Osi, ulz‘ezam, may be used or not, at will.

The optative has a second set of meanings, in which it (t) Poten-
expresses merely willingness to admit consequentes, andill·
approximates to the meaning of a mild future, when it does
not differ much from the sense os concession. This is the
potential use, found in Attic in combination with dv and in
Homer with ἄν or κε’ν.

The use of dv or κε’ν, which is a Greek, not Ῑ.-Ε, usage, implies that

the speaker is thinking of particular circumstances and not making a
general statement. This distinction is most clearly seen in Homer.

The potential optative appears in the apodosis of con-
ditional sentences which state a supposed future case less
vividly than the fut'ure indicative and subjunctive. In nega-
tive sentences ot is employed with the potential uses of the
mood, even where it is used in questions, and has the sense
of a polite imperative, e. g. οὐκ dv δὴ μείνειας, well you not stay?
ie. Slayl This use of οὐ shews that the potential use of the
