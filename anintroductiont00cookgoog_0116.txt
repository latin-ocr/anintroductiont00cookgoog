Neut.
Ace.

Genitive.

Ablative.

Nom. and for

104 Casas in Greek. [o.

doubled in Ζῆ-ν-ο, ι’-υο, τίυο, because the nasal was regarded
as partos the stem.

The Neuter Nomz'native and Accusative is marked by(1) -ν,
1.-Ε. -υι, e. g. ζυγά-ν, Sk. puga-m (2) the simple stem,
e. g. ἡδύ, idm, πέπον (3) -ρ, e. g. in πῖο-ρ, ὕδωρ.

The Gent'tive has as case-signs (ι) -oto, e. g. {monto (sk.
a'sva-sya) = innovo = ἱπποο = Attic ἵππου, Doric ἵππω. Geni·
tives in -οο, e. g. άο, Ἰλίοο, are not found in the Mss, but
are metrically justified as conjectural alterations in Homer,
e. g. we may read Ἰλίοο προπάροιθεν for Ἰλίου προπάροιθεν.
(2) ·κ, e. g. χώρο-κ. In the masculines of the A-declension
the genitive, e. g. πολίτου, is due to the analogy of the
O-declension‚ e. g. ἵππου. (3) ος, in all but A· and O·stems,
e. g. ποδ-όο, nrt-dc, ποτρ-ός, γένους (ysara-os). In I· and U-stems
we find a termination -ως, which belongs to nouns of the type

.0l βασιλεύς, νομεύς wilh genitives βασιλῆ-ος, νομὴ-ος, whlch by

metathesis of quantity become βασιλέως, νομέως. Upon the
analogy of such forms we find πόλεως, φάσεως, which however
retain the accent of πολεος, φάοεοκ. The form Σωκράτοο has
replaced Σωκράτους on the analogyof πολίτου, in the same way
as Σωκράτην appears for Σωκράτη on the analogy of πολίτην.
The Ablatz've had in the Indo-European O·stems a
special termination -d preceded hya long vowel, as in Lat.
Gnazhdd. In Greek we find the Cretan τῶ-δε (heac), and
Locrian ὣ and άπω (unde). The Attic ά-δε, οὕτω, οοφω of
σοφά-τερος, as well as the adverbs with an additional suffixed
-κ, e. g. οὕτω-ς, καλῶ-κ, may very well be Instrumenlal‚ and -ω
= -o-a. Other suffixes with an ablatival meaning are -τος,

’ asin ε’ν-τός, ἕλε-τός, and -θεν, in ἔν-θευ, οἴκοθεν, wei-dev, etc.

The Dahae, Localive, and Instrumental were originally
distinct cases, but in Greek the distinctions have not been
maintained.

The Datim was originally a weak case, with a reduced
stem and a lull ending ω( which bore the accent. ίππιρ then
points back to ίππο-ορ, χώρᾳ to χοροί-αρ’, cf. Sk. slnry-az
