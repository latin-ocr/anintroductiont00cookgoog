These last three instances represent a change of writing,
and not a real change of pronunciation.

Dentalsba a. Before a following r or θ another dental becomes
coming a. σ, eg.

deor-ror passes to drea-rou ἶδ-τε to lr-rr; carrd-rur to efreto-rw
ὲψενδ-θην to ἐψεύσ-θηη ἐπιδ-θην to ἐιεὶσ-θην.

Dentals appear to pass into σ before μ, but this is not the
fact, as we can see from ἐρετ-μόε, οἶδ-μα and nadair. Cases
where they appear to do so must be explained by analogy.
Thus ἴδ-μεν is turned into ἴσ-μεν to make it follow the
analogy of 'fo-re, πεπυθ-μαι into πέπυσ-μαι lo make it like
πίπυσ·Τω.

According to rule, σ before μ should disappear. It does
sein cl-pl for ἐσ-μι,εἶ-μα for etr-pa, ἢ-μω for ἡσ-μω. But some-
times this σ has been restored before the μ, to make the word

resemble other forms of the same tense which have σ, eg. εῖ- ’

μέν has passed into ἐσμέν like a’orr', ἕξω-μενος (cf. (hac) into
ἔζωσ-μίνος to make it like ἔζωσ-ται, and similarly in many
other instances.
