76 Strong and Weak Roots. [ch.

βολ-, fieli- or στολ-, aral· of other tenses. How are we to
find a single root which shall be common to all the parts
ol βάλλω and στελλω and their derivatives? Or, again, in the
case of γόν-ος, γέν-ος, γί·γν-ομαι, stupa-pen, what is the element
of unity common to them all?

Strong and It does not seem possible always to discover a single root

ἓοζζξ or unity sor a group of words. Roots present themselves
under two main forms, the Full or Strong, and the Reduced
or Weak. The full form is distinguished by having the
vowels e or 0, as e. g. in λείπ-ω, λε’-λοιπ-α, or by having a long
vowel, as e. g. in ἔρ-ρωγ-α. The weak is distinguished by the
absence of e or o, as e. g. in ἕ-λιπ-ον, or by having a short
vowel, as e. g. in ἐρ-ράγ-ην, ἔ-λᾶθ-ον.

Classifica- The best way of classilying roots is to divide them into

the following classes:

1. Roots which end in a semivowel (i, u, m, n, r, l).

11. Roots containing a semivowel followed by a con-
sonant

111. Roots not containing a semivowel, and ending in a
consonant.

IV. Such roots as θη, mci, δω in Greek, which do not fall
under any ol the other three heads

All the roots which can be classed under one ol the first
three heads contain, or once contained, in some forms the
vowelse ono, and are then said to be strong or lull roots
In other forms these vowels have disappeared, and the roots
are then called weak or reduced.

For instance, under class Ι will corne the roots ol the verb
yi·yv-0pat, viz. asyw as ln γέν-ος, csyov as in yda-os, ssyr as ln
γί-γν·ομαι, ¹and slya as ln γε’-γα-μεν. Of these, asyev and tsyvv
are strong, esyv and elya are weak. The only difference
between Asyr and ss γα is, of course, that γν- appears belore a
vowel, while γα· (which is sor γρ) appears belore a consonant,
the a representing the nasal sonant. Ι

Under class II will come the roots of such a verb as

Roots.
