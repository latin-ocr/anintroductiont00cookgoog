Vowels

and the lower or soft palate (velum), oi which the lower
extremity (uvula) can close the entrance to the nose passage.
Apart from speech the breath passes through the throat,
mouth and nose without appreciable mund, and the different
organs lie at rest. In order to articulate, the passage of the

¹ breath is regulated and the position of the organs of speech is

altered at will. A stream oi air is drawn into the lungs and
breathed out in bursts of different length and strength.
Voice depends upon the contractiora and vibration ol the
vocal chords ; in the case of awhisper there is less, is any,
vibration. In forming uon-hasal sounds the passage to the
nose is closed up. The sound is nasalised if the passage be
open, in the case oi vowels as well as consonants. In the
Freneh nasals en, vait, un, there is a guttural as well as a
nasal dement, not so much however as in the English ng.
The number of possible sounds is infinite, and to classify
all is impracticable. For instance, in the word cat there is
not only the c-sound, the a-sound, and the t-sound, but also
the transitional sounds made in passing from c to a and from
a to t. These are not represented in the spelling of cat.
Again, no two human beings pronounce any of these sounds
in exactly the same way, sor it is not to be supposed that in
pronouncing c-a-t everyone sends exactly the same amount
oi breath from his lungs, contracte or expands his musc'les
to exactly the same degree, or has exactly the same shape oi
throat or mouth as everyhody else. Nor again would the
same manha found to pronounce c·a·t twice in exactly the
same way, nor could he do so unless he were a perfectly
accurate machine. Consequently it is impossible to set
down and classify all speech sounds. A limited number of
types or normal average sounds is chosen, ,and upon their
characteristics our definitions are based.
. First af all we come to the great distinction between
