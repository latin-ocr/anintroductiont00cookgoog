82 Confustbn of Series. [ch.

The regular variations which we have given in the above
six series cannot be found in all roots. For instance tsplt, as
ln πίμ-πλη-μι, pli-nus, does not vary.

The true series is sometimes lost. For instance, χαν-
δάνω really belongs to the bseries, as we see from the fut.
χείσομαι which ls fol· χενδ-σομαι. The word χανδ-άνω really
contains a nasal sonant, χζιδ-ανω, but the a was regarded
as original, and hence we have χανδάνω, «exauda. Again
πάσχω (undeno), ἕ-παθ-ον, add-os seem to belong to the ἄ·
series, but πένθ-ος, πείσομαι (need-noym) and πέ-πονθ-ιι point to
an t-series.

Sometimes in an &series we find ω as for instance in :-

echon-vl vute-m t-xadae-qv.
σκοπ-έω nula-voturi.

. φόνος otuu
δῶ, debu-u ddu-os deu-w.

νωμάω ndu-os νέμ-ο-μω.

Other variations from the rule might be found, but they
are not numerous or important. The great majority ol in-
stances os variation in the vowels of roots can be grouped

under one or other of the six series of gradations which we
have given.

Aecum.

The importance os accent in the history ol language has
only recently been recognised. A few years ago it was a

was oxytone but πόδα paroxytone. We have however seen
in this chapter that vowel variation is closely connected with
accent, and we shall see subsequently that accent isos great
importance in the infiexion os nouns and verbs.

Accent is either exspz'ratory, depending on the greater or
less stress laid on the accented syllable, or mast‘cal, de·
pending on the pitch or to'ne at which the syllable is pro·
nounced. No language is wholly accented in either way,
