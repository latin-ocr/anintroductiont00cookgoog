Veerinite For the sake os practical convenience two main divisione

{nlth' oi the verb are made, into forms Fz'nr'te and forms Infinita χ

me' The forms of the Verb Finite contain elements signifying
differences of person, number, time, and modality, and are
distinguished from other parts of speech by the union in one
and the same word of Subjec! and Predz'cate, which are sever-
ally expressed in the ending and the stein. The endings are
called Person-Endings The Verb Infinite in the InfinitiveS,
ParticipleS, and Verbal nouns belongs properly to the nominal
class. The Infinitive in Greek sor instance was, as we shall
see, originally the dative of an abstract noun.

Inflexional In Inflexional languages like Greek and Latin there is a

forms. great variety of grammatical forms. The Greek approxi-
mates most closely to the Sanskrit, and from a comparison
oi these two languages we obtain our idea oi the structure
oi the Indo-European Verb. Greek and Latin mark by
changes oi form the character oi the predication and the

mental attitude oi the speaker. This is what we understand
by differences of Mood (ἐγκλίσεις). Differences of time are

marked by differences of Tenue (χρόνοι), which again are
expressed by change ol form. So too with differences of

Person (πρόσωπον) in the subject of the proposition ; os
Number (ἀριθμός) ; oi the state oi the subject (διάθεσις),
which we call Vor'ce. All the foregoing differences oi
form are embraced under the general term ol Conjugation

(συζυγία).
