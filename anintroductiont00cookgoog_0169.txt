these cases, therefore, the long vowel of the perfect admits of
ready explanation, and it is possible that these four verbs,
together with video aidi, jdcio je'ci and one or two similar
perfects‚ formed the type on which the others were subse-
quently modelled. At any rate the wide extension of this
form of the perfect in Latin, as compared with other lan-
guages, can hardly be original, and as the vowel change has
not yet been explained by phonetic law, we are obliged to
bare recourse to analogy.

So far we have dealt with perfecta, of which the rst sing.
is formed by adding -ito the simple stem, whether redupli-
cated or with a long vowel. But these constitute aminority
of the existing forms, the bulk of which are produced by the
addition not ofa simple ῑ, but of ῐ preceded by (i)s or (ii)
v or u.

Amid much obscurity one thing is certain, that the ἔπ’
was originally no part of the perfect system. It has nothing
to answer to it in the perfect forms either of Greek or
Sanskrit.

lt can however have been introduced onlyfrom one source,
the system of the sigmatic aorist. As in dealing with present
stems we saw that some were formed from present stems
proper, some from the stems of strong aoristS, though the
distinction of meaning which presumably once existed
between the two types (lego = I am choosing, but ago =l
do) eventually disappeared, so in a somewhat similar way the
sigmatic aorist and the perfect inflexions coalesced in one
form, which combined the meaning of both tenses.

ardere is usually thought to be asigmatic aorist subjunctive,
corresponding to the Greek [ειδέ(σ)ω, Sk. *bedrici-(pr). ln
a non-thematic tense we expect a short connecting vowel,
and this we find in veilent, vadem, arderemus, Sk. aldricus,
