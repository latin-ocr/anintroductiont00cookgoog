v111.] Lr'quid Stems. 97

The stem oi ἥρως seems to end in oga, eg. acc. ἥρω or
ἥρωα (= iuvi-vl·

Liquid Stems with ‘Strong Inflexion' are found (r) in liquid

nomina agentis, such as δώτωρ, δοτὴρ, Stems.

Thus
δώ-τωρ Sk. dri-ta.
natvm Ι dri-trimus.
In Epic we have aoc. μήστωρα vvith the long ω oi the nom.

Another variation oi the suffix appears in σῶ-τερ, and a
weak degree in ῑα-τρ-ός, which gives a series.
“mp- -τψ -τρ-.

The original declension of δώ-τωρ perhaps gave acc.
δώ-τορ-α, and with shifting of accent and wealrening oi root
the genitive δο-τέρ-ος. This variation of stem however was
not maintained, but gave rise to the two systems δώτωρ,
δώτορος and δοτὴρ, δοτῆρας. The weak degree appears in some
derivatives such as ψάλ-τρ-ια, torp-62, while others shew the
suffix -τερ- (δᾶνειρα sor dorrp-rn).

(a) ln the nouns ry relalzonslrip such as πα-τὴρ, etc„ where
the stem variation is -rep- in the strong cases, such as acc.
πα-τέρ-α, and in the weak cases -τρ-, eg. πα-τρ-ός, or with the
liquid sonant ·rpa·, e. g. πα-τον-σι, arrepti-ov.

In Latin, as we should expect, we find still greater
uniformity than in Greek. The nomina agentis everywhere
have the suffix -trir- with the long vowel carried throughout

⁸ the system, apparently on the analogy of the nominative.
It is however to be noticed that whereas -τωρ in Greek is

only added to strong stems, in Latin it appears as the suffix
of wealr stems (dd-lor).

Names of relationship in Latin have the suffixos -ver (in
nom. sing.) and -lr- (in the oblique cases); and this latter
appears also in feminine forms like janitrices. The name oi
relationship soror may be classed with nonn'm agenni ior in·
flexional purposes.
