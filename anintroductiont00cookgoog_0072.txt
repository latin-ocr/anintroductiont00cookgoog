60 Rhotacism. [ch.

(2) Represents an original τι, eg. φόσιςεφᾶτις, φασί --
duvia, τύπτουσαι· τυπτοντξα.

(3) Is due to analogy, e. g. doadi keeps itso like θριξί (=
θρικ-σι).

Rhotaeism. In Latin intervocalic r becomes r, a change known as
Rhotacism. Nearly all cases ol s between vowels stand lor
an earlier ss aster a long vowel; eg. Cicero wrote caussa.
Comparing Greek, where s disappears, with Latin where it
becomes r, we have νυός nurus, lde orius, οὔατα aurii, γένους (=
γενεσος) generis, Μουσῶν (τ- Μουσασων) Musarum. The date of
this change from s to r between vowels is usually thought to
be fixed by Cicer0, ad Fam. 9. 21, where he says that L.
Papirius, cos. uc. 336, was the first to change his name
from Papisius to Papirius. The question is not however
finally settled, and in some words, e. g. miser, the sis kept at
all periods. ,

S also passesinto r before m, n, u, g, as in

ver-na, Vos-to3 veter-nus, fleer— (ἔτος); Car-mena, for Carnicum
sur-vus,fus·cus; Miner-va, μένεα· (μένος) ; diur-nus, nudius (tertimh
dedier-nus, dics.

A final s never becomes r in Latin by phonetic law ; arbor,
melior, etc. are due to the analogy of the intervocalic s (= r)
in the oblique casea, and honos, lepos are the common sorms
in Cicero.

This lact has an important bearing on the final ·r ol the

passive, which cannot therefore come from the -s of the
reflexive.

Itis possible to distinguish between the semivowel p* and
the palatal spirant y (or j), but it is not possible to make any
distinction between the labial p and the digamma. The old
grammarians represented the sound ol the digamma by ov.
This ου was pronounced almost or entirely in the same way

as the semivowel p, and corresponds to the sound ol the
English w.
