ur] Stemsin ΝΠ. 131

present-stema is mostly poetic, except δείκ-νυμι, ζεύγνυμι, and
ὄμ-νυμι.

The verbs in ·αννυμι, -εννυμι are post-Homeric, e. g. κερ-άννυμι,
wop-iamne, etc„ which have been formed on the analogy os
ἕν-νυ-μι (·- feo-vum). In Atiic, ἕσ-νυμι should pass to 1εἷ-νυμι,
as σν passes to νν only in the Aeolic dialect. However, in
place of the regular Attic combination ν with lengthening of
the vowel we have the Aeolic -νν- in ἀμφιέννυμι, (omps
(= ζωσ-νυμι), σβέννυμι (afim-vum), Which shews that the
law that ·σν- passed to ν with lengthening of the vowel had
ceased to operate at the time oi the formation of these verbs.
On the analogy of ζώννυμι were formed later ῥώννυμι, orpha
νυμι, and on the analogy of ἅμφι-ἔννυμι, σβέννυμι were
formed πετάννυμι, κορέννυμι. The word ἀμφιέννυμι, as we
see from the augment of ἢμφίεσα, was looked on as a
simple verb.

As with σν, so with σμε in Attic the σ should be dropped
with compensatory vowel lengthening, and so ἑσ-μαι becomes
εἶ-μαι. But σ has been restored in ἦμφίεσ-ιιαι, ἕσβεσ-μαι,
isar-par on the analogy of forms in which it has been
regularly retained, e. g. ἢμφίεσ-ται, etc.

(4) The Fourllr Closs (ff Prerenl Sterns add νᾶ, vri to the 4.Ι Stems
root, and are mainly confined to Homer :- th Μ’
erip-vem, δάμνᾰ-μεν, cf. Sk. frmi-mi, fr-ni-mds, where ἱ answers

irregularly to Glr. d.

These verbs are mostly non-themam, but sometimes pass
over to the thematic conjugation‚ eg. πίτ-νη-μι becomes ,

πιτ-νά-ω.

Under non-thematic stema we must note the stems of the passive Passive
aorists in -ην, ·θην. The aorists passive in -ην mostly have the wealr Αῡήῦῒῦ-
form ol root and are peculiar to Greek. Their person-endings are active
inform, their meaning intransitive or passive. The passive has arisen
out of the intransitive meaning. Thus in Attio Greek the intrans.
ἀποθανεῖν is used as the passive of ἀποκτείνω, and γίγνομαι as the pass.
oi ποιέω. Similarly the aorists in ην have passed from an intransitive
