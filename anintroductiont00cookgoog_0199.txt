ἀδικὴσομω, I shall be wronged. We have already discussed
the origin of the passive aorists in -ην and -tivyv(p.131). The
person endings oi these aorists are active in form, and the
passive sense has grown out of the intransitive meaning ol
the stems. Thus in Homer many oi the aorists in -ην are
intransitive in meaning, e. g. ἐχάρη, hc reshiced, ῥυῆναι lo floro.
If the cause of the action is to be expressed, this is done by
the addition of an instrumental case, e. g. Πηλεΐωνι δαμείς, he
collapsed at lle hands os theson os Peleus, where the dative
expresses the circumstance which attended and caused the
action. This easily passes into the passive subdued dy tle son
osPeleus. How closely the intransitive and passive meanings
are related we can illustrate by comparing ἐκόπη ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ
with ἀποθανεῖν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ, where the aorist‚ active in form, is used
as the passive os ἀποκτείνω, and similarly in Latin poetry we
have such phrases as ab hoste cadere. As further instances
of verbs active in form and intransitive in meaning used ina
passive sense, we may quote ἐκπίπτω, φεύγω, pereo, veneo.
Special instances of verbs middle in form habitually used in
a passive sense are κεῖσθαι as passive of τίθημι and γίγνεσθαι as
passive of ποιῶ.
In Latin as in Greek the passive was developcd from the The

middle voice, but in Latin the passive has supplanted the {prve ³¹¹

rare and mostly poetic, e. g. zhduzlur cornua, he puls on horna.

middle or active meaning, and are to be found at all
periods os the language. In the early Latin there existed
in many cases active forms with the same meaning, eg.
zlnr'to beside rhn'lor: in other cases there are traces of active
forms with a transitive meaning, corresponding to the later
deponents with a middle meaning. Thus compotz‘re, lo make

Latin the past participles of deponents are sometimes used
in a passive sense, and the gerundives universally. The lact
