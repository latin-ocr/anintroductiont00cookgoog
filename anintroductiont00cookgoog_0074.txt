{pislfflnd The Spiritus asper appears in Greek as the representative
ἐξ os a lost s, f or χ’. The sign ol the rough breathing was
in the earliest times Β, but in the Ionic alphabet this
symbol was given the value of an e‘·sound. When the Ionic
alphabet was adopted in Attica, the sign for l was dropped,
and the spiritus asper accordingly no longer stood upon the
same level as the other consonants The Ionians bear wit·

ness to aweakness ol distinction between the rongh and

smooth breathing, since they do not aspirate a preceding
tenuis before an aspirated vowel in cases ol elision, but write,
e. g. ἄπ’ οὗ, κάτοδος, etc. The Alexandriana adopted l- as the
sign os the rough breathing.
An initial rough breathing in Greek represents-
(1) An original s in-

' ' l, οὗ, οἵ, suus, ςι; ἕδος, sedco3 ἅρπη, sarpo; ἑπτά, septem.
(ο) An original f in—
ἥλος, vallus; ἔννυμι, vcstis3 ἕσπερος, vespm ἑστία, Vesta.
ln other cases the f is represented before vowels by the
spiritus lenis (p. 61).
(3) An original ξ’ in-
lls, Sanslrrlt yds3 ὑμήν, walatam loplvnyudlv- ; ὑμεῖς, yusmtin.
Belore an initial υ the aspirate regularly appears, even
where there was no original initial consonant, e. g.—

ὔδωρ, Sanskn't “dim ὑπό, dpa3 ὑπέρ, updri ; ὕστερος, littura.
