v.] T he Hard Palafal. 53

eco. que seems regularly to become cu or co except at the
end of a word and before r; thus colo is for qudo, concredo for
conquetio, but quercus remains unchanged.

A palatal k is represented in Sanskrit by f, in Greek by κ, Ηηῆᾱ pata-
in Latin byc under all circumstances. A few instances will tal k.
suffice.

The law of the transformation of the solt velar g is pre· The ,ονε
cisely the same as that for the hard velar q. '²¹⁸¹ d·

In Sanskrit there is no trace of a succeeding labial ᾳ, and
g becomes the corresponding palatalj before the thin palatal
i (y) and a (=I.-E. e). Elsewhere it is g.

In Greek, if labialised, g becomes before ι,ε the corres-
ponding dental d: before o, τ, θ, r, liquids and nasale, it
becomes the corresponding labial β or its equivalent. Other-
wise it appears as γ.

ln Latin it would seem in the first instance to have become
gp, just as q appears as qu, but this gp only remains after
nasals in the middle of a word. Initially it appears asg
beforeconsonantS, as u before vowels. Medially between
vowels it is ν.

Ι. Velar g unlabialised is Greek γ, Latin g. Unlabial·
