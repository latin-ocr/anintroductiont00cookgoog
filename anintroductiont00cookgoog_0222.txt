210 Mood in Dependent Clausen [ch.

still remains in English and in Greek, as the pronoun he may
equally refer to A or B. Greek and English are content for
the most part to leave the solution of the difficulty to the in-
telligence of the listener; Latin alone provides an expedient
by means ol the pronoun re, which ceases to be employed as
the ordinary third personal pronoun and becomes a reflexive,
referring in the majority of cases to the person whose words
are reported. Itis interesting that Sanskrit preserves in
such cases the exact words of the original speaker, only
appending to them the particle ili, to indicate that an exact
quotation is being made.

The change of mood is more difficult. In Greek the
rule is that alter primary tenses, where the dependent clauses
all have a relation to the time of the speaker, the original
moods are kept; after secondary tenseS, where the depen-
dent clauses have a relation to some event in the past, the
optative is for the most part employed. We might have
expected that in final clauses, for example, to which by the
nature of the case the subjunctive of will is appropriate, to
find alter primary tenses in the main clause primary tenses of
the subjunctive, after secondary tenses secondary tenses of
the subjunctive. There is, however, no reason to suppose
that either in the subjunctive or in the optative any distinction
ol trine exists between the primary and secondary tenses
(p.189j. If this is so, the secondary tenses are obviously
inappropriate to express the required relation, and the opta-
tive is therefore employed, not as conveying precisely the
meaning required, but as approximating to it in being
analogous in meaning to the subjunctive, and less vivid.
The expression ol will is inappropriate to past events ; the
expression os expectation is at least less inappropriate. By a
somewhat similar shilt Greek uses the past tenses of the in-

dicative in such cases as-
rl μ’ οὗ λαβὼν
ἔκτεινας εὐθύς, ὡς ἔδειξα μήποτε
ἐμαυτὸν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔνθεν ἦν γεγώς,
