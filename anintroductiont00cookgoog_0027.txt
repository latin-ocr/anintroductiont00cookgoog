larities which we find between its different descendants. We ι
can draw upa genealogical table of descent for the Romancc
languages, but this is not possible with the whole body of
Indo-European languages, which are of much wider extent
and much greater antiquity.

Besides Genealogical classification, we can classify lan-
guages Morphologically, that is, according to their system of
grammatical forma, their declensions and conjugations.

Language consists of words, grammatical forms, and Morphe-
syntax. Morphological as distinguished from Genealogicalss‘l'ffica·
classification is based upon systems of grammatical forms, tion.
and it is by these that languages can be best distinguished
into groups of larger or smaller extent.

Upon this principle of classification there are three great
families ol speech: Radt'cal,Agglutai1alzbe,and Inflexional,
distinguished according to the way in which they combine the
roots or main significant elements of words with those other
elements which mark the distinctions of person, number,
gender, tense, mood, or case.

In the lnflexional group, to which all Indo-European lnflexional.
languages belong, a distinction may be made between roots
which are Preai‘calzbe and roots which are Pronominal. The
predicative are the roots ol nouus and verbs, and form the
bulk of roots in any language; the pronominal are a smaller
body from which are derived pronouns‚ conjunctions, particles,
and some prepositions. From the combinatione of these two
different sets of roots may arise the different parts of speech
and their several inflexions, as for instance the cases of nouns.

Iu the Inflexional type of language roots have no separate
existence apart from words. In any Greek or Latin iu-
flexion we discover the root, or main significant element
which wc can trace no further back, ‘by breaking up the
word into its parts. The terminations, which were possibly
Pronominal in origin, have no independent meaning apart

· from their connexion with the rest of the word in which
