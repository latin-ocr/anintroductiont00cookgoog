Latin has acquired the power of expressing temporal rela-

But though the use of the pres. subj. in such clauses for
future conditions requires no comment, the very remarkable
usage by which the imperf. subj. is used of unreal conditions
in present time yet awaits explanation.

what he was doing‚' neither A nor B being any longer
parties to the conversation. It is true that an ambiguity
