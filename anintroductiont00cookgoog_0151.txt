midd., e.g. esruy ἕτετόχ-ατα, assperr τετράφατο. No stem
ending in a dental shews aspiration, e. g. euroeam.

From the 3rd pl. perf. midd. the aspiration passed to the
active voice, and from ἐτετάχατο came τέταχ-α, from τεαρίφ-ααακ
came re‘rprdt-a.

Why there is aspiration in the 3rd pl. perf. midd. is not
clear. It is not due to the endings -αται, ατο. It must be
based on the analogy of those forms in which aspirationis ·
regular, eg. from J τρκβ we have τέτραψθα = τατριβ-θα by
Greek phonetic law, and from esra-s τέταχ-θαεκεκαγ-θα. Upon
the analogy of these forms have come τετρίφαται, τετάχ-αται.
In dental stems there would be no similar analogy‚ e. g. from
κῘακευαδ we have ἐακεύαα-θε for locontur, which provides no
model for aspirating the dental of εἀκευόδ-ακα.

The Perfect in -κα is a formation peculiar to Greek. Perfect in

refeired to ss dfert· 0f δει-δίσσαμαι (εδεδηῐικ-ηαμαι), and βέβηκα
may be compared with βάκτρον. The aorist ἔθηκα (cf. θήκη)
must be explained in the same way. The κ came to be re·
garded as part of the suffix and not as belonging to the
stem, and so was added on to stems which contain no κ, ,
eg. ἔφθαακα, and the aorists ἔδωκα, ἧκα. In Homer the
perfect in -κα is rare.

The Pluperfect serves as an augmented preterite to the The Plu-
perfect. There are two main formatioris of the tense. (ri-pem
Where the Pluperfect has the perfect stem with augment
and secondary endings, eg. ε’-τέτυκ-τα. In Homer we find
thematic ε’-γέγω-νε, ε’-μέμη-κον beside γέγωνα and μεμηκώς, and
ἤνωγον beside ἤναγα. Sometimes too the present perfect
stem assumes thematic present 'endings, as in dvdy-n,
