viru] Casas in Greek. 105

The ending -ag' appears in the Greek infinitive fo-pem,
Sk. vt'olman-e.

The Locatzhe was originallya strong case with full stem Locative. ·
which burethe accent, and suffix -ί, Remains of this case in
Greek can be seen in οἶκε-ι, rideri, πανδημεί, and Lat. domi. ln
the O-declension -οι has replaced -ει, as for instance in οἴκοι,
πέδοι, ἐνταυθοῖ. In the Adcelension we have χαμαί, eufim-
γενὴς, and παλαί-φπτος.

In the other declensions there is a single case-ending -z',

e. g. ποιμέν-ι, aer-t, which seems to be locutive. In such words
as ὀπ-ί, πων-ἰ’ we find the stem weak with the ending accented‚

which are marks of the dative, together with the ending -i
which marks the locative. The two cases, in fact, are no
longer distinguishable.

The Instrumenlal ended in -ἄ, and is found in a few Instru-
adverbial forms such as ἅμ-α, ned-d, and in compounds such as mental.
ἑκά-εργος and ἑκη-βοἊπε. Sometimes it contracts with the vowel
of the stem, as in Attic πῆ, πανταχῆ, perhaps also in οὕτω, etc.

The Nom. and Acc. Dual have as their case-ending (r) -ε, The Dual
e. g. βό-ε, πατέρι, πόδ-ε. Such a word as γε’νεε for ymo-eNumb‘r·
should in Attic properly contract into γενει. The analogy of
the plurals γένη, ἄστη has led to the dual forms γένη, πάλη,
πὴχη, ἄστη, etc. In the I- and U-stems we find βάσεε, βαρέα,
but the Sanshrit duals gaft, gurzl lead us to suppose the
correct forms to have been βασῖ, Rapo. (a) -ω, e. g. ἵππω,
Lat. ambo. In Sanskrit the dual is cimon, though there is an
older osvo. This double form points to an original 1.-E.-0·p
before avowel, and -ὁ before a consonant. In Greek and
Latin the -riu appears in dyhofoc, octav-us, as we see by com-
paring ὀκτώ, octo, with Sk. actore. (3) -ᾶ, e. g. χώρᾶ. The
Sanskrit has risve, which points to an ending -αί, The nom.
plural χῶραι has then the form of the true nom. dual, while
χώρα is a new formation modelled on ἵππω.
The Genitrhe and Datim ending is (r) in the A·declensi0n
