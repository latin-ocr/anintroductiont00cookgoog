192 T lre Perfeci. [ch.

occur in subordinate clauses and represent the corresponding
tense of the indicative in a principal sentence. Otherwise
they have no temporal sense but merely denote the character
of the action, for, unlike the indicative, they are without the
augment which in Sanskrit and Greek is the sign of past
time. The use of the optative to express past time in
reported speech is peculiar to Greek, though there is a
more or less corresponding use of the subjunctive in Latin

The perfect iu Sanskrit is used as a tense to denote
sustained and energetic action. The sense of completed
action which belongs to the perfect may have been developed
from the sense of sustained energy‚ e.g. βέβληκε, makes ln's
hei, after doing his best. In Sanskrit the perfect appears as
a present of completed action like the Greek κρατέω, I am
uictoribus, and, like the aorist, it is sometimes used in place of
the imperfect as the tense of narration. In Greek we find
the perfect in Homer used to denote a permanent state, o g.
ἕμμορε, hasfor leis share, or an altz'lude or temper, e. g. δέδεγμαι,
am in waeteizg, ἔολπα, hope, and it is rarely used ih the
sense of the English perfect with leave to denote an action

that is completed, a use which is common in later Greek and ,

in Latin. ln Homer the aorist is used in this sense, e. g.

νῦν δὲ κακὴν ἀπάτην βουλεύσατο, he llas devt'sed. The Homerlc ¹

sense of the perfect remains in later Greek in the use of
μεμνῆσθαι, οἴδα, τέθνηκα, Latin memmi, nour} but as arule the
perfect comes to express completed action. In Latin the fact
that the forms of the aorist and perfect have been confused
has led inevitably to a confusion of meanings, and so the
Latin perfect answers to both the perfect and aorist in Greek.
Periphrases in Greek and Latin, like οὐρανὸς γεγονώς ἐστι,
pecunias collocatas habeo, are not to be regarded as equivalents
of the perfect, but contain a double predication, eg. have
been rhvesled, and I haue them.
