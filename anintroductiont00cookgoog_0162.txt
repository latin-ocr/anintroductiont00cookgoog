150 Non-thematis Verba. [cu.

To this class belong all verbs of the 4th conjugation and
those ol the third whose 1st s'ing. ends in -io or -ua It is also
usual to compare amo, moneo with the Greek τιμάμ, dinero, in
which case all verbs of the rst and and conjugations would

¹ also be sod-verbs ; but as ama-nl, mone-nt, and other forms
can hardly be sor amai-ont, monci-ont, it is perhaps better to
consider these conjugations as at least partially non-thematio

Non-them· We have already remarked that the bulk of non-thematic

{3503th verbs become thematis in Latin. Thus ple-o corresponds to

thematic. rip-rrlq-pn sar-0 (for sels-o) to (σ)ι’-(σ)η-μι, ster-nuo to πτάρ-νυ-

μαι, ster-no to στόρνυ-μω Even when isolated non-thematic

forms survive, other forms have been assimilated to the

thematic type ;ser-'s,fer-t, ser-lis, fer-re are non-thematic, but
fir·22mm,fir-u·nt have the thematic vowel.

The transition seems to have begun with the plurals.

Thus, sor example, corresponding to the Greek (all-ornile,

(oli-orde, (cr)t'·or‹'1-‹rt‚ plur. (σ)ι’-στᾶ-μεν, (σ)ι’-στᾶ-τε, we should

get in Latin sztsta-m, wssstd-s, sztstnt, plur. sistri-mus, sistri-trs.

But sistrimur, sisldlzi must become sistimus, sr'slzlzi, as con-

cdpil becomes concipit, with lior original ἄ in an unaecented

syllable. This short iis not distinguishable from the ῑ

representing the thematic vowel (in e. g. reg-inus), and so

by analogy we have stilo, szitz's, for stitdm, sistris. The same

would be true ol the type sero (for sis-o), plural s22st-mus, si-

sZ-lz's-Greek (ahloh-per, (o)r'-(rr)r·rr—bec0mlng serimus,

seniis. Compare also the eompounds ol do, ln which rid-dt-

mus, rid-dato have become regularly addamus, additis, and the

singular has conformed to this analogy.
