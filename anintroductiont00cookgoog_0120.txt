the stem the Homerlc ἒπὲ·εσ·σι for ἐπεσ-εσ-σι. From εἰδώς
we have εἰδόσι (eid-form), with the stem of εἰδότες, εἴα, but
with the weak stem we should have rather had εῖδυσι (εἰδ-

υσ-σι).

An Instrumental ending appears in λύκοις, Sk. vfkdr's,
pointing to an original I.-E. ozi. Upon this model probably
rose the datives of the A-declension in -αις, which only thrice
occur in Homer. There is no corresponding ending viti
from this declension in Sanskrit. The instrumental ending
-φι(ν) appears in Homer, both as plural and singular, e. g.
the plur. θεά-φιν, θύρη-φιν, mirem-pa, as well as the sing.
στρατό-φιν, βίη-φι, ι’·φι.

The Latin noun-system differs from the Greek in having
no dual, with the exception os the isolated forms duo, ambo,
and possibly the neuters of the fourth declension cornu, genu.
lt has an ablative in common use in the singrdar and some
considerable remains of a locative. The dat-abl. plural of
A· and O-stems is instrumental in origin.

The case endings are as follows :-

Numantina-The normal ending is -s‚ which, however,
often disappears under the laws governing final combinations
of consonants in Latin. Thus corresponding to the Greek
ἀγρός we should have Latin *ugron but ro unaccented seems
to become er (compare p. 38), and agers passes into ager.
serente becomes ferens‚but}10mons becomes horno, if this last
type is not formed merely by a lengthening of the last vowel
of the stem, like Gk. ἄκμων.

Corresponding to the Greek type πολίτης we find in Old
Latin parandas, hoslttapas, etc. In later times the masculine
A-stems have been assimilated to the more common
feminine (poeta).

vocative. Vacunae-A distinct form is only found in O-stems,
when the termination is -ι,
