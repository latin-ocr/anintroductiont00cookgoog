24 Greek Alphabet. [cu.

The symbols of our own alphabet are nearly the same as
those of the Latin: these last were horrowed from a Greek
alphabet‚ and all the different Greek alphabets were borrowed
from the Phoenicians. Herodotus (5. 58) says that the art Ῐ
ol writing, as well as other arts, was brought into Greece by
the Phoenicians who carne with Cadmus, while before that 3
time it was not known. It is more than doubtful whether ²
lt was known to the Greeks of the Homeric age; and if 1
letters were introduced before the age of the Wise Men, yet
they were not in common use.

Phoenicius Though the Greeks borrowed their alphabct from the
alphabct. Phoenicium, the Phoenicians were not its inventors. These
industrious tradere handed on to Greece the letters which
they themselves in the first instance obtained for commer-
cial purposes from Egypt. This alphabct became the parent
of almost every alphabet, properly socelled, upon the earth

The Phoenician alphabct as adopted in Greece is different ’
both in the form and value of the symbols from the alphabet
of Phoenicia proper. The most striking contrast lies in the
fact that the original alphabet consisted solely of consonants;
the vowels were not represented by special signs, but under-
stood to be inherent in the consonants. The Greek alphabet
had two main divisions‚ Eastern and Westem. The Eastern
division comprised the alphabct of Asia Minor, the Ionian
alphabct proper, the earliest of all; the alphabet of the
Aegean islands, Thera, Melos, Crete, and others, and the
alphabet of the mainland of Greece, viz. Argos, and Corinth
with its colony Corcyra, as well as the old Attic. The
Western division included the alphabets of the rest of Greece
and of the Sicilian and Italian towns, of which the most im-
portant were the Chalcidlan colonies.

Speaking generally, the Greeks adapted the Phoenician
symbols to their own requirements as follows. Four of the
Phoenician letters, Aleplr, He, Ayin, and I'od, were employed
to represent the vowel sounds Α, Ε, O, I, while a new symbol
