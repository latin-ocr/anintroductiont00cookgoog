vn.] Strong ond Woak Roots. 77

heth-o, viz. altare dhorn, which are strong, and ssim, which

is weak. Another instance is δᾶρκ-ομαι, with its strong

ίδερκ and «stopa, and its weak asopo« which stands for
dgr.

Class ΙΙΙ is represented by the strong essm and asim of
wir-opor and πότ-μος, while the weak tm appears in tm·
ὅμην· -

It must be remembered that in the first two classes of the
above, the sounds r, l, m, n stand on the same footing as i
and u. They are semivowelS, that is, consonants before
vowels and sonant before consonants (p. aa).

The variation between the full and the weak roots was Strong and

· originally accompanied by a change of accentuation. Where {255¹

the accent rested on the root-syllable there was a full root, as
in πείθ-ωνι where the accent did not rest on the root-syllable
there was aweak root, as in πιθ-ών. There are onlya few
instances in Greek, because the system of accentuation has
altered from the original accentuation of the parent language.
For instance, οἶδ-α has a full root in the singular, but a weak
root in the plural ἴδ-μεν. Now according to the original
accentuation we should have old-a, *ι’δ-μέν (p. 137).

We must give up the idea of finding one single form of
the root for all words which are related to one another. ln
λεὶπ-ω, λέ-λοιπ-α, ἔ-λιπ-ον there are three roots, and, so faras
we know, always have been. We do not know why λειπ-
differs from horn, the other strong root 3 we only know that
it does so, Of λιπ-, the weak form, we know that originally
the chief accent of the word did not rest upon it.

Some words have only two rootS, one strong, one weak, as
for instance in lom-pr the strong root is ori, the weak στὸ-
as in ἵ-στό-μεν.

In the same way we have

τί-θη-μι, ride-per.
tt-to-yo, dido-per.

The differente between strong and weak lies in the quan-
