the contact ol the tongue and hard palate, such as k and
gbelore e and 22·

Next come the Dentals, where the tongue, teeth, and front of
the palate are the instrumenta of articulation, e. g. t, tn, d, sle, r.

Foremost in the mouth are the Labs'als, or lipsounds‚
formed either by both the lips or by the under lip and upper
teeth. Such are p, b, m, ,tt

ΙΙ. Consonants can alsobe classified according to the form ²· Form-
of their articulation.

When there is a complete cheelr at the point os articu-
lation, consonants are called Mutes or Stapped or Explonbes,
e. g. k, g, t, d, p, b. In the classifications of the ancient
grammarians Mutes were divided into Temus and Medeae, the
name of Tenues (bare or thin letters) being given to k, t, p,
and that of Mediae to g, d, b. The name of Mediae had no
other meaning than that these letters were ranked between
the Tenues and the Aspe'rates leb, tls, ph. As we no longer
regard the Tenues as thin letters, and gain nothing by calling
sounds middle sounds‚ the tenns Tenues and Medeae, though
still employed, have lost their usefulness.

Where the mouth passage is narrowed but not com-
pletely closed at the point of articulation, we have the Open
or Fre'catz've consonants, such as r, af, a, a, the last four of
which are also called Spe'rants.

Where the passage is stopped in the middle but lrept open
at the sides, we have a divided sound, such as l.

Where the nose passage is left open we have the nasals nr
and n. N takes its character from the nature of the neigh-
bouring sounds; e. g. it is guttural in ank, but dental in tent.

ΙΙΙ. Consonants may, thirdly‚ be divided into Voe'ced and 3· voice.
Vae'celess.

The Voe'eed or Sost consonants are pronounced witha
vibration of the vocal chords. To this class belong the
Nasals n, m, the Lz'qut'ds l and r, the Mediae g, d, b, the
Aspe'rated Mediae gh, dn, bn, and the Sperante z, a, w, j, y.
