96 Diphthongal Stems. [cu.

terminatione of the dat. abl. plural of the 3rd declension, e. g.
ped-ibus.

U-stems usually undergo alteration in Latin. Some neu-
ters in -22 may be originally duals, c. g. cornu, genu, veru, for
an earlier cornu-e, etc. The neuter singular of such words
to judge by the Greek πολῦ, ought to have had short u.
The adjectives in -u become in Latin I-stems, apparently·
through the influence of the feminine, eg. wanze, Gk. ἡδύς,
Sk. suadas, fem. saddai.

Dtphlhongal Stems are to be found in the monosyllabic
Ζεῦ-ς, Sk. dycta-s, Lat. Dz'es-pz'ler. The I.-E; strong stem
was Dido, the weak Dipo. Thus in Greek we have Ζεῦ-ς
(= diuvo) with the strong stem, and Δι-ός (ε Alf-os) with the -
weak. ln the acc. Ζῆ-ιι the semivowel p has disappeared as
in Latin dii-s.

Βοῦς (εβωυ-ς), sk. giu-s, shows the weak stem in gen.

βο-ός (εβοῐ-ος). ln ναῦς (= νῦν-ς) there is no clear trace of ι

stem variation. In all these words the long vowel of the

strong stem has been shortened in Greek before the semi· ¹

vowel .66.
’ In {Stin tbe diphthongalstems have often become I-stems,
and we have noui-s, sends, answering to ναῦς, Ζεύς. ln other

Α cases the semivowel disappears before a consonant, according ¹

to a law which, except perhaps in final syllables, is universal

in Latin, and we get Deis-ptiar, bris, rc's (for reis, sk. ros, ¹

gen. royda), but it survives between vowels in soon, bovz's.
Other diphthongal stems peculiar to Greek are to be found
in βασιλεύ-ς (Ξβασιληυ-ς), ἱππεῦ-ς, δρομεῦ·ς, etc. In Homer
the long vowel of the stem is shown in βασιλῆ-ος (εβασιληξ-οε),
βασιλῆα (εβασιληβα). ln Attio by transference of quantity
we have βασιλέ-ως, βασιλέ·ᾶ.
Stems in -ov- seem to appear in πειθώ, voc. πειθοῖ, acc.

πειθώ (z πειθο-ιι = nudor-o). Other instances are Λητώ, ἠχώ. ’

The Ionio acc, Ἰοῦν for Ἰώ, however, shows vy instead of f·
