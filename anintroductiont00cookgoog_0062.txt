50 The Hard Velar. [cn.

Palatals. (a) The Palatal gutturals, l, g, gh, appear in Latin,
Greek, and the Teutonic languages as mutes, but in the
Slavonic and Eastern languageS, including Sanskrit, as
spirant sounds.
The following is a table :—

Indo-Erpopean. Greek. Latin. Sanskrit.

HardVelar We will now pass on to give instances of correspondence
f· in Sanskrit‚ Greek and Latin, and first of all we will take
the Velar Tenuis q. Now Greek κ and Latinc can answer
either to the Indo-European velar q or to the palatal k. lt is

Sanskrit which enables us to determine the question, because
Sanskrit represents velar q by k, but palatal k by the sibilant
sound f.

labraused. without the labial affection answers to Sanskrit k, Greek κ,

Latinc before a, r and l.

Labtalised. We now pass ou to those cases where the velat q appears
with a labial sound in Greek and Latin, though notin Sanslrrit.

Before the vowels i and e this labialised q or ks becomes

the corresponding dental τ, while in Sanskrit before similar

vowels it appears as c (pronounced asch in English clarck),

which is of course more palatal than dental The dental τ
