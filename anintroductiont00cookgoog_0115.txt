Cosas in Greek.

Tim Gnnrrr Cass Svsrnn.

The cases (πτώσεις) are inflexions ol the stem formed by The Greek,
the addition of suffixes for the purpose ol expressing the ἔξω
relations of nouns to other words in a sentence. Excluding
the Vocatz've, which is not properly a case, there were in the
original language seven cases, viz. Nominalive‚ Accusan‘ve,
Gentem, Dalz've, Locotr've, Ablative, Instrumenlal. Of these
Sanskrit has all, Greek and Latin exclude the Locative and
Instrumenta] from common use, and Greek is withouta
special case form for the Ablative.

The Nominatine case is marked by (1) the simple stem, as The Singu-
in χώρῖι. In Attio, except after ρ or a, ε, ι, the final V⁰w²¹lskrrth¹dln
is almost always η. (a) A lengthening ol the stem vowel, ¹ ¹
e. g. πα-τὴρ, ἅκ-μων. (3) The suffix -s‚ e. g. imo-s, ὀφρὺ-ς, πούς.

The normal termination of the nominative is -e In the
A-declension it only appears in masculines like πολίτῃ-ς, ·
which have followed the analogy of the O-declension. In the
consonantal declensions we have some nominatives with both
a lengthening ol the vowel and -ς, e. g. ἀλώπηξ. Iniuriis.
δούς, etc, for ἱστᾰντς, dovre, the lengthening is in compensation
for the loss of the consonante.

The Vocative has its accent as far back as possible. The vocarive.
terminations are (ι) -ε, eg. ἵππεε (a) -ἅ, e. g. νύμφόε (3)
the simple stem, eg. γέρον, πάτερ.

The Epic μητίετα, ἱππότα, νεφεληγέρετα, etc. are probably
Vocatives which have come to be employed as nominatives
in Homer. They are epithets used as titles of respect.

The Accusalz've is marked by (ι) -ν, for I.-E. -m, e. g. Accusa-
ἵππο-ν, Sanskril ἄρνα-1η, χώρα-ν, ὄρνῖψ, Ζῆ-ν, etc. in Stemsfive'
ending in a vowel ; (a) -α, for I.-E. agr, e. g. πατέρ-α, ardo-a,
in consonantal stems.

In the Attio deciension the final letter is sometimes lost, as
in λαγώ for λαγών, cf. ἥρω. The sign of the Accusative is
