Wn have now to consider the correspondence ol the vowel
sounds ol Greek and Latin. Greek has the short vowels α, ε,

ι, ο, υ, and the long ἆ, η, ῖ, ω, ὖ. Of these a, ahave the value
of Italian vowels; ε, ο were short shut e, o 3 ω was a long open
0‘3 η was an open e· which has since become i in modern
Greek ; υ was originally u, but passed through a modifiedo
to modern Greek τ’.

Latin has the five vowels a, e, i, o, u, long and short.

Bye Dipfithong we understand a combination ol two simple Diph-
vowels, the first os which carries the stronger accent, pro· thongs.
nouneed in a single effort of the breath.

Diphthongshave been usually divided into Proper and Proper
Impropcr. To the first group belong such combinations as {¹1¹}ss “
oi, ei, ou, ou, that is, the diphthongs whose second component diph-
involves a closer narrowing of the mouth than the first‚— thongs.
while in the second group the conditions are exaetly reversed,
and the i and u come first. As i and u have less fulness of
sound‚·it is more natural for them to come in the subordinate
place. .
Taking then the proper diphthongs‚ we may say that a
diphthong is composed of a sonant or syllable-forming letter
followedby a semivowel. A complete list of diphthongs
gives us
