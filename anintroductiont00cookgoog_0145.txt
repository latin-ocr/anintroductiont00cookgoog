tion, however, has been assimilated to that of present stems
with the full root, and the oxytone accentuation is only to be
found in aorists like hex-eiu, δικ-εῖν.

ls there were a λακ-ω, δικ-ω, these would be presents like
γράφω, ylio-o. Such sonns may be called Aorz‘st Prescntn
because though they have the accentuation ol the present,
they have the weak root of the aorist. We must note, on
the other hand, in the aorists ε’λθ-εῐν and γεν-έσθαι that they
have the full root combined with the accentuation of the aorist.

Reduplicated thematic present stems of this class are
γῖ-γν·ο-μαι, pipo-o, ἴσχω (·-· σι·σχ-ω), τίκτω (ε τι-τκ-ω), εἷο,
The vowel of reduplicatlon is ι. With so-called Attic redu-
plication we have the Attic aorist ἤγ-αγ-ον, and in Homer there
are more, e. g. ἅλ-αλκε, ἤρ-αρε, etc. With ε as vowel of redu·
plication we have κε-καδῶν, τε-ταγῶν, ε’-πέ-φν·ομεν.

(6) The Sz'xth Closs ofPresenl Stems consists of the root 6.Ι Stems
and the suffixes -to-, -χε- answering to sk. -ya, mlh ³²·
The suffixes are added on
(r) to roots ending in gutturals, e. g. δράσσομω (εδραχ-ῳ-
μαι, cl. δραχ-μὴ), τάσσω (may-go, cs. τάξις), σφάζω (εσφαγ-ιω,
cf. σφαγ-ἡ).
(2) Το roots ending in a nasah in which case there is epen-
thesis of ι, e. g. μαίνομαι (2 ponto-par), φαίνω, salvo, etc.
and wilh strong root κτείνω (επεν-(ω).
(3) To roots ending in aliquid, e. g. βάλλω (zoeli-go),
ἅλλομαι (εᾶλ-(ο-μαι), and with strong root φθείρω (ε pesp-yn),
and στελλω (arch-yso).
(4) The root is sometimes reduplicated, e. g. with ι in
τιταίνω(-- τι·ταν-(ω); with other reduplication ln παι-πάλλω,
ἇ-ίσσω ( = ‹l-frx-yo), etc. ἢ
The Denominative verbs form their present stem by adding innomina-
·yo·‚ -μ- to a nominal base, e. g. τιμά-(ὴω, delli-(rho, ppos-(ylo, mes·
δακρὺ-ωω. Later formations are the denominatives in -οω,
e. g. χρυσό·(()ω, and -srlo, e. g. βασιλεύ-(ὴω. ”
