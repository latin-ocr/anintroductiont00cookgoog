So

Stridebat deformis hiems praedamque recentem
Servabat: tamen hic properat.

Here we have real logical subordination, which is also
indicated grammatically by the tenses employed, though all
clauses alike would ordinarily be classed as principal. The
same distinction is observed even when the logically main
clause is syntactically subordinate, e. g.

Talia iaetabam et furiata mente ferebar

subordination. Often they act as clauses giving the condition
of the action ol the principal clause, and may be paraphrased

indicates that to the grammatical conscience ola primitive
people their action was conceived of as posterior to that of
the main clause. Syntactically they are distinguished by the
lact that the time from which they are regarded is fixed by

the main verb. They will include not merely clauses ol
