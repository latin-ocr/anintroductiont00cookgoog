208 Conditvonul Clausus. [cu.

The use oi the subj. in causal cum and relative clauses in
Latin belongs to the special syntax oi that language.

(ii). Clauses which limit the action of words of saying
and thinking by giving the object os the verb. Here again
the syntax of the two languages separates Τὴε most
important class are the indirect questions, which in Latin
universally have the subj. ln Homeric Greek the subj. is
found in double questions with ἣ-ἦ, and in such cases as
πειρήσεται αἵ κε θέῃσι, bul in these cases the subjunctive is
deliberative (p. 196) and the clause is to be classed as final.
Here again, therefore, we must look sor an explanationes
the construction in Latin alone sor the most part.

(iii). Clauses of condition and limitation, with tica relative
adv. of time, place, or manner (ὡς, ὅτε, ὁππόθι), and εἷ. The
subj. only appears in classical Greek in combination with
dv. The typical case in Greek is the εἰ clause, with subj.
and opt, though the opt. with an adverb in an indefinite
sense is of some importante. In Latin, with some excep-
tions (such as the cum clause of circumstance and other
adverhs in analogous senses‚ which seem to take the subj. by

a purely Latin idiom), the si clauses are the most important.
Concessive clauses fall under the same head, but of these
quanquam has the indic, while quamm's takes the subJ'. only ‘in
virtue of the original paratactic construction, quamvis taceas
properly meaning ‘you may be as silent as you like.'

Putting aside the combination of adverhs with ἅν or κε as a '

purely Greek idiom, not falling within the domain of com-
parative syntax, it ls plain that t'or Greek the εἰ clauses are
the most important for the determination of the original
meaning of the opt. and subj. in these constructions. In
these clauses it can hardly be doubted that the subj. and
opt. are the subj. and opt. of will and wish. The negative is
regularly μή, the negative notos statements, but of com-
mands; and εἰ was perhaps originally os an interjectional
character, as in εἰ δ’ ὅγε, introducing expressions of wish or
