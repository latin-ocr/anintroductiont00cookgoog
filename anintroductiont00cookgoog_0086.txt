7. The admissible combinations of final consonants will
be found in any grammar, and to this we must refer fora list
of the more obvious phenomena of assimilation, etc.

One or two other phenomena may be classified here.

Dissimila- The dislike to more than one liquidos the same kind in

*1⁰¹¹- aword is common both to Latin and Greek. In Greek we
have δρύφακτος for δρυφρακτος, ἀργαλέος from ἄλγος, ἐλπωρή but
φειδωλὴ.

In Latin the suffixos -alz'r, -culum alternate with the suffixes
-arr's, -crum‚ according as the preceding syllables eontain r or
l. Thus

exemplaris, altan'a, salutaris, but fatalis, venalis, etc
= invola-crum, simula-crum, but pulcer, natrano, etc
ct also Parilia from Pales, and the complete loss of the
liquid in praestigiae (rimago).
Where two similar syllables follow one another, one tends
to be lost both in Greek and Latin. Thus

antonno, ἐὔθηλοι Halairwlrlfra

trufcihidarc, vene(nr')ficium‚ nutriflnbis, etc.
