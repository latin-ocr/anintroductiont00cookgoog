x.] F titel Clauses. 207

δΐζε γὰρ dl μάχοιτο, καλ. δῦν’ Ἄϊδος κυνέην, μή μιν tto« ὄβριμος
Ἄρης.

Α word is due to consecutive clauses. In Greek ὥστε is
constructed with the indic. or the infin, and the question oi
the moods does not come in. The subj. in consecutive
clauses in Latin is remarkable, but is perhaps to be placed
with the Greek opt. as expressing a possible or an expected
rather than an actual state of things. Non talei sum qui hec
factem means I em not the man who would (in a conceivable
case) de thet. As lar as the ut-clauses, however, are con·
cerned, it is possible that the analogy ol the final clauses
may have been operative. An expected result is not to be
sharply distinguished from a purposed result, and as in
Greek the ὥστε clauses with the infin. approximate to the
meaning ol the final infinitive, so in Latin ut nenand utne are
often almost interchangeable. The question how a clause
¹ expressing the expectation of a possz'ble result came to be
used to express a real result belongs to the special syntax of
Latin.

Under the head of Final Clauses in Greek may be put the
final clauses after ἵνα, ὡς, ὅπως, ὄφρα, μή, the relative clauses
expressing purpose (in the Homeric usage with the subj,
which is replaced in Attic lor the most part by the fut. indie),
and the temporal clauses with ἕως (ἄν), etc, in the sense of
until. Ι

In Latin we have the final clauses proper (whether with ut, '
ne, or a relative), the consecutive clauses, and the clauses with
dum, eto, so lar as they take a subjunctive.

The Conditional Clauses include all those clauses which condition-
express the pre-existing conditions which determine 0r³¹C¹³¹¹⁵⁶⁵'
modify the action of the main clause. Thus they include :-

(i). Causal Clauses, whether with the relative or with a
particle (ὅτι, οὕνεκα, ὡς, qued, qm'a, quoniam, eto). These,
however, may be ignored for our purpose, as the mood in
Greek is universally indie, and to a great extent in Latin.
