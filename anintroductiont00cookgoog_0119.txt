neut. plur. was originally marked by the long vowel, e. g. Sk.
paral, Lat. tri-grata, but endings in -a have been preferred,
e. g. βαρέα, τρία.

The Genitr've Plural has for its suffix -ων, which stands for Genitive.
an original l.-E. suffix vim, e. g. ἵππων for lma-dm. ln the
Adeclension we have χωρῶν, Epic dadon. The formation
has here been modelled on that of the pronominal declension,
e. g. τάων for τᾶσων, Sk. taram. In the declension of feminine
adjectives and participles in -η, the gen. plur, e. g. φίλων, has
not the circumflex accent unless the word is oxytone
throughout. In the A· and O-declensions the long vowel of
the ending is due to contractiori with the vowel of the stem.
But this long vowel has by analogy been transferred to the
other declensions, and we get not-dv (not ποθ-ον), νεκύ-ων, etc.
The genitivos πόλεων, βάσεων are accented on the analogy of
their genitives singular.

The Localt've ending is -σι, e. g. θῦρᾶ·σι, 'Addua-ot, wamel-ut, Locativc.
ποιμέ-σι, etc, in Sanskrit -su, e.g. dene-ru. The uses of Dative
and Locative have coalesced and the case-fonns cannot be
kept distinct. In the Adcelension, besides the ending in -ιισι
already given, we find -ῃσι and -αισι, e. g. νύμφῃσι in Homer
and hippotae: in the O·declension we have λόγοι-σι. In the
I· and U-declensions‚ instead of βασῖ-σι, βαρῦ-σι, we find
βάσε-σι and βαρέ-σι, with the same vowel as the rest of the
plural (p. 95). From νέκυς we have Epic νέκυσσι as well as
vend-tout. From βασιλεύς we have βασιλεῦ-σι, shortened
according to rule (p. 66) from βασιληυ-σι, as also is ναν-σι’
from νῦν-σι’. Regularly, of course, σ between vowels should
disappear, but from thc influence of the love of uniformity
intervocalic σ was kept in the dative· on the analogy of forms
where it was not intervocalic‚ e. g. θρα-σι, θριξί.

In Liquid stems we find the weak¹ stem in πατρά-σι, Sk.
pali-ru, while on the other hand φρε-σί has replaced φρα-σι
for ungi-at, and has kept the ε of the other cases.

ln S-stems we have ἔπεα-σι, Att. ἕπε-σι, or with doubling of
