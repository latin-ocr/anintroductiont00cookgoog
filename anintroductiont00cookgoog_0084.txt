72 Combinotions in Latin. [cr.

oar-ga passer to poium dxv-ror to oleron beram-ga to rtrum
And similarly with μέλαινα, σώτειρα, μοῖρα, and others.
ln κρείσσων, μείζων there is no Epenthesis as we can see
from the Ionic forms κρέσσων, μίζων. The εν of κρείσσων and
μείζων has been introduced rather on the analogy ol such
comparatives as χείρων.
Dissimile· Diisimilotion is most common with aspirates‚ as e. g. in
Μ’ τίθημι lor itiam ludicro lor ἑφυθετος ἔταφον lor reaper.

The aspirates are changed because ol the Greek rule
which permitted of only one aspirate in a word (p 63).
Metathesis. Metalhrris is very rare. The consonants appear to change
their places in τίκ-τω sor τι-τκ-τω, and in σκέπ-τομαι as com-
pared with Latin spec-rb.

The only initial combinations allowed in Latin are those
of a spirant followed bya mute, two spirants, and a mute aud
semivowel. In any other combination one or more letters
arc dropped.

Thus a comparison ol sternuo with πνιίρννραι shews that
the original stem was psternu-‚ and tilio seems to correspond
to πτελέα.

1. In many cases a stem beginning with s lollowed bya
mute appears both with and without the sibilant in different
lorms. Thus

tego, ardys—tibia. orrida—cutis, uiros-scutum, ordros-torus,
irrupimus-parcus, σπαρνός.

It is suggested that originally thes was only lost when the
preceding word ended with a τινιιῑε,Ι so that the block of
consonants thus coming together would have been unpro-
nounceable. The same principle may underlie the loss ol a
final s so common in Latin poetry up to the time of Cicero.
Il quiescit stands, as seems probable, sor squiescit‚ ‘confectus
quiescit’ would naturally become coifictu' quiescit, as it does in
the well-known line ol Ennius : ‘nunc remo consectu' quiescit!
