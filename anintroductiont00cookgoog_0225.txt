X] Relatr've clauses. 213

compound sentence when the demonstrative pronoun (Gkvelopment
ὅς), which properly is deletio, and refers to some object in {2}ng
the external world present either actually or mentally to theClause·
speaker, comes to be used as an anaphoric pronoun,
referring to something previously mentioned in the sentence.
This is the history of the Greek ὃς, the German der, the
English that. Thus these pronouns come to be used merely
as a formula for introducing a logically dependent clause,
and a clause logically dependent comes in time to be
regarded as syntectically dependent.

For example—-

nul ἅμ’ ἡγεμόν’ ἐσθλὸν ὄπασσον
ὃς xl με ιεῖσ’ ἀγάγῃ,
no doubt originally meant ‘Give me a gurile,· he shall (is
lo) lead me'3 but the latter clause, always logically subor-
dinate, develops into a clause syntactically subordinate, and
we translate ‘Gz'ue me a guz'de who may lead me!

The interrogative pronoun in Greek and Latin is also the
indefinite (rie, τις, quis, qur), a fact which is made intelligible
it we consider the similarity of meaning between Who will
do thar? τίς τοῦτο rothom quis horsacr'el? on the one hand,
and Wt'll any one do that? τοῦτο ποιήσει τις lroc fizciet quis)
on the other. Out of the interrogative use Latin has de·
veloped the anaphoric or relative use. The Latin relative
clauses are cases of simple parataxis, the relative being
originally interrogative :-Quem librum habeo? eum librum
do, becomes quem librum habeo eum librum do, a formos ex-
pression common in legal Latin 3 and then by economy of
language quent librum tabeo do, eum librum quent habeo da,
and even librum quem habeo do. Alter the pronoun has
corneto be merely relative, there is no difficulty in the varia·
tion of the order of clauses The same thing has happened
in the de clauses in Greek, which ought strictly to follow,
but frequently precede the main clause. In a similar way,
the modern English zolro is both interrogative and relative,
