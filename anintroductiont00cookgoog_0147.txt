iio] Inceptives. 135

suffix -το- can be referred to ψ, e. g. xdie-w, σκόπ-το,
τύπ-τω. Where the root ends in other consonants (e. g. in a
guttura] in πέπ-τω speq Lat. coquo, ine in βλάπ-τυ cf.
βλάβ-η, in φ in βάπ-τω cf. βαφ-ὴ), we cannot refer the suffix
-το- to -2o·. Possibly βλάπ-τω, mittin-ro, βάπ-τω, κρῦπ-τω have
been formed on the analogy os τὺπ-τω. The similarity os the
aorists ἔβλαψα, ἔκρυψα, emta led to a similarity of the pre·
sents as well, just as the similarity of ἔσφαξα (adeso) and
ἔφραξα (optino) led to the formation os a later present σφάπω
to replace σφάζω. In some verbs we have to assume the
suffix -το- as original, e. g. in νίπ-τω, irin-ro, πέκ-τω.

The verb σκέπ-τομαι seems to have come by metathesis
from ona-iopen, Lat. spec-ib, Sh. ptis-ydmi.

(8) The Ez'ghth Closs (ff Present Stems consists of the root 8. Stems
(weak) and the suffixes -σκο-, -σκε-, e. g. βά-σκω, φά-σκω,ζῗθῗὴώ
fidam. The same suffix comes in the denominatives γηρᾶ- ' ⁴
σκο, cipi-exo, μεθῧ-σκω, and in the iterative preterites os Ionio
Greek, e. g. φεῦγι-σκε, nidifico-ose, etc. The Attio θνή-σκω,
θρῴ-σκω, μι-μνῄ-σκω have added an iota on the analogy of
verbs in -ισκω, e. g. εὖρ-ίσκω, ‹tt-tomum. The origin of the ι
is unexplained.

The suffixes -σκο-, -σκε- are added to reduplicated roots in
γι-γνώ-σκω, βι-βρώ-σκω, heht-m sor δι-δαχ-σκω, ε’·ί·σκω for

ε’-ξίκψκω (cf. ἴκ-ελος like).

(9) ne Ninth Closs ‹y‘ Present Stems is made up os the 9.Ι Stems
root with the suffixes -νο-, -νε-, eg. δάκ-νω. This class is the ''252‘'
counterpart os the non-thematic fourth class.

The root if short by nature and position is nasalised and

the suffixes are -ανο-, ·ανε-, e. g. hand-dvo, λιμπ-ἇνω, ‹tvo-dvo,
λαμβάνω, etc. In ληθ-άνω the root is full and not nasalised‚
and we have the weak root without a nasal in ἁμαρτ-άνω,
οἶσθ-ἄνομοι, βλαστ-άνω.

In other verbs the suffixes are -vfe, offe, eg. φθα-νξω,
φθι-νξω, in Homer φθᾶψω, ddi-vo, in Attic ῲθᾶ-νω, φθῗ-νω.
