Semi-Vowels. ⁹

It seems that a distinction must be made between this a or
y sound and the spirant y or j, The Indo-European languages.
seems to have had both sounds. In Greek an original y at
the beginning of a word is represented by ζ, while in Sanskrit
and Latin itis represented hythe same sound as ξ.

Sanskrit. Greek. Latin. antish.
yugdm ζυγόν jugum yokae.

The Greek ily-roe has the same root as Sk. elyas (offer),
and points to an original initial h but Greek ζέω answers to
Sk. elyas (be heated), Lat. jus, and points back to original y.

ln Greek Ζεύς the zhas come from an original dp, as we
see from Sk. aalydem Lat. Iov-ir, Dies-piter.

IndoEuropean ξ’ between two vowels fell ont in Greek
alter all vowels except υ, e. g.: dfegoe = δέος, &opopa = δείδω,
reposto = τιμάω, φιληω = φιλέω, δηλοξω = δηλόω.

ot p alter consonante we speak elsewhere (p. γι).

The consonantal ξ’ in Latin at the beginning ol aword
appears, as we have seen, as j.

Medially between vowels it disappears and contraction oi
the vowels then sometimes ensues. Thus flep'o becomes fleo,
fimio becomes fim'o, but stain becomes sto.

After consonants it is maintained, but the preceding con·
sonant itself is generally lost, e. g. Joat‘r, Gk. ztir, both going
back toa stem ἐξεφ, aio from ahio, Gk. ἤχωεν. Where the
consonant did not disappear, the ξ apparently remained con·
sonantal, and thus we have arian, abiete in the poets. The
termination -ius in patriar stands ior an earlier aios: ci. Sk.
petr-tyn.

Indo· The consonantal p seems to be represented in Greek by

{man the Digamnra, which is asz'rant sound answering to Latin v,

English w. We can distinguish i from y (j) in Greek because
initial ξ’ became the rougb breathing‚ while initial y became ζ.
