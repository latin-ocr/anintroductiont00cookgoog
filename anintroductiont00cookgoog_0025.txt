long past history, and must therefore have been the language
of a numerous race. Such arace would be spread over a
wide extent of country, and in that case there must have
been a tendency to form dialects We need not assume
that the primitive speech was everywhere the same, or that it
did not vary like every language which is spoken bya
numerous race in an extensive country and in arr age when
communication is not developed. The differences which we
can discern in the languages of Europe may have begun in
the dialects of the primitive speech before the Indo-Euro·
peans left the plains of Asia, and afterwards have been
increased.

A more satisfactory metaphor than the genealogical tree ‘Wave’
to represent the relations ol kindred languages is to compare theory.
their differences to waves‚ by which we imply that all the
languages of the Indo-European familyformed once‚as itwere,
acontinuous whole. The parts which were adjacent stood in
close relation to one another, and the splitting into different
types was the result of differences of dialect, which arose
within small limits and were gradually extended like waves.
The relation of different languages is thus explained as
much by geographical as by genealogical considerations.
Neighbouring dialects borrow from one another, but dia·
lects widely separate have no close mutual connexion. For
instance, arr original ry becomes π in Attio, Boeotian and
Euboean, and in these dialects alone, since Attica, Boeotia,
and Euboea are contiguous districts. In the sarne way
rhotacism, or the change of σ into ρ, is introduced into later
Laconian from the neighbouring Elis. The upshot is then
that, if we take one peculiarity as the basis of our division of
languages or dialects, they will be grouped in one way, but if
we take another peculiarity the grouping will be different.
No classification is final, but that is best which is most
convenient for the purpose in hand.
