88 Accent os Nouus. [Ch

Panidptef lt must he remarked that participles and mfinifives, ¹¹⁰1
pinguem· being finite verbforms, were never enclitic md therefore
keep the historic accent in Greek, cf. bhttran φέρι, ric&
mar, ‚rm-'an aar, ruwet„ ,aare 50 eiu oompounds,
the finite verblorms were enclitic, and threw the acuent
back, e. g. sambram σῦμφφε, api arti ἕπωηε the non-enclitic
forms kept the historic acoent, eg. ἐπιλαβόν, aaaron, but
κάθηται.
nerent ot We see therefore that the Greek verb in its finite forms
ΜΨ· presente everywhere the recessive accent as a substitute sor
complete enclisis. From the verb in all probability this new
system ol accentuation extended itself to the noun, but only
partially and irregularly, and even in varying degrees in
different dialects. The Aeolio dialect, it is well known,
unisormly employs the recessive aecem, writing eg. strupo:
lor the Attic ποταμός. In this dialect accordingly the
analogy of the verbal accent has been fully operative. Iu
other dialects tbe question is more complicated‚ aud the
influence os analogy more partial. Certain types seem
every where to have been preserved. Verbal adjectives in
-τός, adjectives in -ρός and -ὖς, strong aorist and perfect
participles ol the active are uniformly oxytone. On the
other hand substantives in -τις are barytone in Greek, though
apparently originally oxytone. Compound adjectives of the
type μητροκτονος are paroxytone il they are active, pro-
paroxytone if they are passive in sense. But except for
some few generalisations of this kind it is impossible to say
anything very definite. In particular the question of ac·
centuation in enclisis proper presente great difficulties, though
here again we may see the working ol analogy, e. g. in τινων,
which, though containing three morae, is completely enclitic
on the analogy ostensuros, etc.
The shifting of the accent in certain vocatives is an in-
teresting survival from the original language. In Sanskrit,
vocatives where accented at all have the accent on the first
