υτ] The Infinitive. 145

These imperative forms, though identical in form with the
unaugmented indicative preterite forms, must he considered
apart. Their meaning is conjunctive, and in the oldest·
Sanskrit they are used with md (μή) to express prohibition.
They have been called Pseudo-Conyicnctrhe or Injunctiue.

We thus see then that the Imperative as a mood has been
put together out of odds and ends. It boasts two endings of
its own, -dhr' and -tdd, and uses the verb-stem sor another.
For its other needs it has annexed certain conjunctive forins
which are phonetically identical with unaugmented preterite
forms ol the indicative.

< As to tenses, Greek has added the imperative endings to
the aorist and perfect stems as well as the present. In San-
skrit rarely any but the present stem is used3 in Latin never
except in mmm-to.

In Greek we say μὴ κλέπτε, but μὴ κλέψῃς. Ιττ old Sanskrit
md was used with pseudo-conjunctive, not imperative forms,
In Greek μὴ κλέπτε was admitted when the imperative had
become a mood‚ but the sigmatic aorist imperat. act. and
middle was a later formation, and μή continued to be used
only with the aorist conjunctive, not with the new κλέψων and
κλέψαι.

Infinitrhe.

The forms os the Infinitive are in their origin substantival. The Infini-
In Sanskrit the so·called Infinitive ends in -tum or alum, e. g. nve Mood.
from tsi (to go), infin. llum. In the older language a number
os verbal nouns in various cases are used in constructions
which make thern resemble the infinitive oi other languages.
Thus srom the stem vrilmdn there is the dat. uzilmrinc, which
answers to the Greek infinitive fihpevar. The dative ddudne
answers to δοῦναι (Cyprian deferat), and from the stem dauon-
there is no other case. As far as Sanskrit is concerned we
may cancel the name oi infinitive altogether and speak
instead of datives and other cases os verb'al nouus. These
datives can, like other Sanskrit verbal noune, govern the same
