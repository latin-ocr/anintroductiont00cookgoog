Ι 144 -The Imperative. [cn.

Imperatrhc.

The Imperative has neither in Greek nor Sanskrit any
peculiar mood sign. It is formed by adding the proper
person-endiugs to the tense stem. Moreover‚ the impera-
tive has few peculiar person endings. The only exclusively
imperative forms are:

(ι) The pure verb stem used sor and sing. in thematic
verbs, e. g. φέρε, rege.

(a) The form in -θι, Ι.-Ε. -dhr', e. g. Sh r'lre‘, ivr-rh, in non-
thematic verbs

(3) The form in -τω, Lat. -tr, Sk. -tat, e. g. φερέ-τω, Lat.
γεεί-ἰόφ), Sk. blara-trit, I.-E. -to'd, bbere-trid.

A Greek form ἐλθετῶς, and sing, is quoted. In origin the
ending may be explained as the ablative of the pronominal
stem to added as a suffix to the verhstem (p. 160).

Not only are the peculiar forms few, but persons and
number are not always distinguished, e. g. the old Sanskrit
ending in -tav usually used as a and pers sing. is also used
as 1st and grd sing. and as and plur. Hence it has been
supposed that the Imperative originally (like the Infinitive)
had one formation used lor different persons and numbers.

. Of the forms of the Imperative as we find it in Greek and
Sanskrit, the and and grd dual and and plural are indis-
tinguishable from the corresponding unaugmented forms os
the preterite indicative. Thus in Homer we have unaug·
mented imperfecte, e. g. φέρετε, etc, and also corresponding

imperatives, e. g. φέρε-τε, φέρε-τον, ivr-rr, ἰ’-τε, deleo-rr, κεκράγε· 2

τε, Lat. vehi-te, mone-te, ‹es-te, dci-te, etc, Sk. blara-ta, etc. In

the singular we have σχέ-ς, lulum-e, and the middle forms ¹

ἵστασο, τίθεσο, θοῦ (answering to unaugmented forms of
ὲ-τίθεσο, &dealt in Latin e's (cd-s), e‘s-ie (ed-le), is (es-s), Zs-te,
ser (ser-s), vel (vel-s). The forms orl-s, ἕ-ς, θέ-ς (with short
vowel, however) answer to unaugmented δως, ἧς, qu, while
the augmented forms ἐδως, ἐθης have been replaced by ἔδωκας,
praesternas. ⁵
