but the relative use has been developed out of the interroga·

latter meaning.

It isto be noticed that the possession of pronouns and
adverbs from the stem jo forms one ol the most characteristic
points oi Sanskrit and Greek as opposed to Latin, and
necessitates a different explanation of the dependent relative
clauses in the two groups os languages. Without going into
the question at greater length, we may notice that there are
three other important points common to Sanskrit and Greek,
but not found in Latin—distinct forms for the passive as
opposed to the middle voice, the prohibitive negative Sk.
md, Gk. μή, and the particle κε’ν, Sk. kam. These facts taken
together seem to vviden the guli between Greek and Latin,
which the morphology of the languages has already proved
to exist.

teristic in a remarkable degree ol Greek and Latin. The
name is consessedly a misnomer. In origin the accus.
could only have been constructed after the main verb.
Thus ln λαοὺς δ’ Ἀτρεΐδης ἀπολυμαίνεσθαι ἄνωγε, λαούς is the
direct object of ἄνωγε, and the infin. is purely epexegetic
(gave an order lo the proplesor purffying themselves). But in
ἄκουσε τείρεσθαι τρῶστ the accus. by itself cannot be
regarded as the object of dravus-rather the object is the
state or action indicated by the infinitive, and the person in
the state or performing the action is indicated by the accusa·
tive. But inasmuch as τείρεσθαι Τρῶας implies the statement
ἐτείροντο Τρῶες, τείρεσθαι ls practically predicated ol Τρῶας, and
this construction accordingly becomes the type whenever a
clause containing subject and predicate is subordinated to a
verb ‘sentiendi et dicende? even though these verbs for the
most part cannot of themselves take a direct accusative.
