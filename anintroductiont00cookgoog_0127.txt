The interrogative stem I.-E. qo· appears as πο- in Art. ποῖ,
ποῦ, πό-τερος, etc, and κο· in Ionic κοῦ, etc. The Lat. stem is
qun. The I.-E. qe· appears as τε· in Ion. τέο, τέῳ, τέων,
τίοισι, Att. τοῦ, τῷ, etc. The Lat. stem ls quen

The composite stem ὁ-πο- is to be found only in adverbialtre.
forms, e.g. ὅπου, ὅπως, lon. drus. The forms ὅππως, durus
came from ὁδ-πως, ‹tt-rue by assimilation of the nom. acc.
neut.

Gk. τίς, interrogative, as well as the indefinite and encliticrts.
τις, Lat. quir, has in the Greek inflexion a nasal which does
not appear elsewhere. The stem τι· appears in the dat. pl.
τίσι and the neuter sing. τί, and is also to be found in Ion.
ἅσσα, Att. ἅττα. Original rra, used as an enclitic, passed to
σσα, πα, and the forms ἅσσα, ἅττα are due to the fact that
σσα, πα occur only alter neuter plurale ending in a, e. g. Ar.
Bon. 172 πόσ’ ἅπα; lor πόσα πα;

The ν of the oblique cases was probably extended horn
the acc. sing. τινα. The regular accusative would be τιν, but
just as Ζῆνα with a doubled accusative ending rose out of Ζῆν
and led to a new formation Ζηνός, so out ol τιν came τινα, and
led lo the inflexions τινος, τινι, etc.

The adjectival τόσος, πόσος, and ὅσος answer to the in· τόσος, etc.
declinable Lat. tot, quot. They have probably been formed
by the addition of the suffix -to from indeclinable words
which have now disappeared in Greek, e. g. ror-yos, τόσσος,
τόσος.

We may refer the adverbial suffixes -θεν, -θι, -θα, -κι
to a pronominal origin. To -θεν, as in αἰνόθεν αἰνῶς, and
-θι, as in ἠῶθι πρό, we can find no parallel in the cognate
languages. With -κι, as¹ in οὐκί, πολλάκι, we can compare
A.-S. lit, the neuter of he.

to· in ta-m, tuen, is-tc (older istus), to-t, ter-lis, etc.
