So far the subjunctive has been shewn to signify the
speaker's will, which as directed to other persons becomes
a command. The subjunctive theu has been used in
imperativa} senses. We now corne to the uses in which
the subjunctive approximates to the uses of the future indi-
cative and expresses what is bound to happeu. Both these
senses of the subjunctive are found in Sanskrit as wellas in
Homeric Greek, and both must be attributed to the sub-
junctive of the original language, nor are we in a position to
pronounce that the one is older than the other. ,

1. In negative statements with ot, e.g. οὐ γάρ πο τοίους ἴδον
ἀνέρος οὐδὲ ἴδωμαι (Homer), no nor shall I ειη in the 3rd pers.
οὐ γάρ τίς με δίηται (Homer), no one shall chare me.

2. In interrogative sentences, eg. τί ποιῶ ; what am Ilo
dol This use is called the Deliberative Subjunctive, and
might be classed as imperatival, for the negative is μὴ, eg.
τί λέγω τί δὲ μὴς but on the other hand we find the future
indicative employed in a similar sense, eg. μητέρ’ ἦ φο-

νεύσομεν ; In Latin, non is the negative which g'oes with the
Deliberative Subjunctive, but it is difficult to class this use
of the mood here, owing to the fact that there are no sure
traces in Latin of the subjunctive in a future sense.

Of the above uses of the subjunctive in Greek we must note that they
ar'e mainly Epic. The only uses of the subj. in independent sentences in
classical Greek arethe Hortatory, Deliberative, and Prohibitive. It is
the Epic uses which correspond to the Sanskrit and which represent the

original language,

The fundamental meaning of the optative mood is weil.
As in the subjunctive we found sometimes the sense of wall,
and sometimes a sense of the necessity of the future, so in
the optative we find sometimes a sense of wahl, and at
other times merely an admz'ssz'on os posstltlz'ly. The optative
is amilder mood than the subjunctive in meaning, for wr'slt
only implies a desire to realise what you may not succeed in
